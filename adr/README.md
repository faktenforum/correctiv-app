# Architecture decisions

Twenty-four decisions shaped this repo. Read them when you want to know *why* something
is the way it is; [`../ARCHITECTURE.md`](../ARCHITECTURE.md) describes *what* it is.

| | Decision | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [0001](0001-monorepo-and-platform-free-core.md) | A monorepo with a platform-free core, and why the directory is `app-core` | accepted |
| [0002](0002-vite-8-rolldown-evaluation.md) | Stay on Vite 7 — Rolldown silently drops the NativeScript polyfills | moot since 0007; kept for the measurement |
| [0003](0003-audio-capability-spike.md) | What the audio stack can and cannot do, measured on a device | accepted |
| [0004](0004-react-native-pivot.md) | Move to React Native / Expo, with a web target | accepted |
| [0005](0005-react-native-over-nativescript.md) | Expo is the stack; what NativeScript was better at, and when to revisit | accepted, amended by 0006, carried out by 0007 |
| [0006](0006-one-core-two-hosts.md) | The core holds the behaviour; both apps stay for now | accepted; its second host is gone (0007), its core split is not |
| [0007](0007-removing-the-nativescript-host.md) | Removing the NativeScript host — the audit first, then the deletion | accepted; two claims retired by 0011 |
| [0008](0008-uniwind-over-nativewind.md) | Uniwind over NativeWind, and Tailwind v4 | accepted |
| [0009](0009-redux-toolkit-for-the-cores-state.md) | Redux Toolkit for the core's state | accepted |
| [0010](0010-design-tokens-as-a-shared-package.md) | The design tokens as a shared package | accepted |
| [0011](0011-naming-the-app-for-release.md) | Naming the app for release, and letting the old host go | accepted; retires two of 0007's |
| [0012](0012-a-list-virtualizer-for-the-unbounded-lists.md) | A list virtualizer, for the two lists that need one | accepted |
| [0013](0013-native-tabs-and-a-web-tab-bar-of-its-own.md) | Native tabs on the phone, and a web tab bar of its own | accepted; verified on Android, iOS unrun |
| [0014](0014-the-preview-shell-as-a-package.md) | The preview shell as a package that can reach the app | accepted; its package and its folder retired by 0024, its same-origin argument intact |
| [0015](0015-reading-correctiv-org-through-its-rest-api.md) | Reading correctiv.org through its REST API, not its RSS feeds | accepted; retires the CORS item in 0006, unopened in a browser |
| [0016](0016-a-door-at-the-root-and-an-entitlement-not-an-amount.md) | A door at the root, and an entitlement rather than an amount | accepted; simulated sign-in, two of its statements retired by 0018 |
| [0017](0017-native-rendering-as-the-rule-a-webview-for-the-exception.md) | Native rendering as the rule, a webview for the exception | accepted; corrects a frame-header claim in `ReaderView.web.tsx`, one open question named |
| [0018](0018-removing-the-guest.md) | Removing the guest | accepted; carries out what 0016 left standing, retires two of its statements and one of 0004's |
| [0019](0019-identity-lives-in-the-session.md) | Identity lives in the session, the contribution in membership | accepted; retires two of 0018's, and the invented contribution with them. Its open question and five claims retired by 0020 |
| [0020](0020-no-contribution-in-the-app.md) | No contribution in the app, and one link out | accepted; answers 0016's join-flow question, deletes the membership slice, retires five of 0019's and one row of 0012's |

| [0022](0022-three-tiers-of-colour-and-a-dark-scheme-that-names-roles.md) | Three tiers of colour, and a dark scheme that names roles | accepted; adopts wp-design-tokens `8ed7a28`, retires two of 0010's |
| [0023](0023-the-host-constructs-the-store.md) | The host constructs the store | accepted; recorded after the fact, corrects one claim in `ARCHITECTURE.md` and four comments |
| [0024](0024-the-handbook-owns-the-root.md) | The handbook owns the site root, and the app moves under it | accepted; retires two of 0014's, its argument untouched |

Eight notes for readers of the older ones:

- ADRs 0001–0004 were written in German and translated on 2026-08-11, so the repo
  reads in one language ([AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md#language)). Only the wording
  changed; the German originals are in the git history.
- ADRs 0001–0004 cite a strategy paper (`APP-STRATEGIE.md`, revision 2, July 2026)
  that recommended staying on NativeScript. ADR 0004 reversed that recommendation and
  the paper was removed from the working tree on 2026-08-06; it is in the git history
  if you need the original wording.
- ADR 0005 scheduled `apps/mobile` for removal in a phase 5; ADR 0006 suspended that
  schedule; [ADR 0007](0007-removing-the-nativescript-host.md) carried it out on
  2026-08-12. Read 0006 for what the core is and why, not for how many apps there
  are — that half of it is history, and the reason it gives for the split is the
  reason the split survived the removal.
- The app directory was renamed from `apps/mobile-rn` to `apps/mobile` on 2026-08-28,
  and the package from `@correctiv/mobile-rn` to `@correctiv/mobile`
  ([ADR 0011](0011-naming-the-app-for-release.md)). Paths in the ADRs are left as they
  were written, so read `mobile-rn` as today's `mobile`. **Do not read it the other
  way round.** In 0005, 0006 and 0007 the bare `apps/mobile` is the *deleted*
  NativeScript app, which is why 0007's decision line reads "`apps/mobile` is deleted.
  `apps/mobile-rn` is the app" and means two different directories.
- ADRs 0002 and 0006 describe a NativeScript app that is no longer in the tree. They
  are records, not descriptions: neither has been rewritten, and 0007 says which of
  their statements have expired.
- The same applies to 0004 and 0007 wherever they name **zustand**, **NativeWind**,
  `nativewind-env.d.ts`, `.dark:root` or `stores/create-store`. The state moved to
  Redux Toolkit ([0009](0009-redux-toolkit-for-the-cores-state.md)) and the styling
  engine to Uniwind ([0008](0008-uniwind-over-nativewind.md)); those passages are what
  was true when they were written.

- ADR 0022 counts the app's raw colour values and gets it wrong by two. That
  sentence is struck in place, dated, and says which two sites it missed. It is the
  one strike in here that no later decision caused: the claim was false when it was
  written.

[ADR 0022](0022-three-tiers-of-colour-and-a-dark-scheme-that-names-roles.md) retires
two claims in 0010 about the dark palette. Both were true when written: upstream's
dark block really did hold the light values, and `palette.js` really did assign every
grey by role. wp-design-tokens `8ed7a28` deleted the first and made the second
unnecessary. 0010's decision — the package is the shared one, the app writes nothing —
is untouched.

[ADR 0015](0015-reading-correctiv-org-through-its-rest-api.md) retires the CORS item
in 0006 and four claims in the top-level docs. Read its last section for the list; the
short version is that "correctiv.org sends no CORS header" was true of the RSS feeds
and never of the REST API.

**How an expired claim is marked.** An ADR is never rewritten to look right in
hindsight — the reasoning is the part worth keeping. A claim a later decision made
**false** is struck through where it stands, with one clause saying what voided it and
a link to the ADR that did; the argument around it is left intact. The newer ADR
carries a section naming every statement it retires, so the two ends cannot drift
apart. See 0004's store and storage-port paragraphs, and 0006's ports table. The rule
is in [AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md#decisions).

ADR 0004 is long because it doubles as the changelog of the pivot. Its "Offen"
section is superseded by ADR 0006's "What is still open", of which
[ADR 0007](0007-removing-the-nativescript-host.md) closes all but the CORS item —
which [ADR 0015](0015-reading-correctiv-org-through-its-rest-api.md) then closed too,
by finding that the missing header was a property of the RSS feeds and not of
correctiv.org.
