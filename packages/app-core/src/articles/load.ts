/**
 * Getting an article onto the screen, as one cascade.
 *
 * There were two of these once, and they disagreed about the order. One asked the
 * cache first and fell back to its bundled copy only after the network failed.
 * The other checked its bundle first and never cached what it extracted. This
 * takes the better half of each.
 *
 *   1. the host's bundle      — pre-extracted, needs no network, never changes
 *   2. a fresh cached article — extracted earlier this day
 *   3. the REST API           — one request, everything, no parsing
 *   4. the article page       — fetch, extract, for what the API cannot answer
 *   5. a stale cached article — expired beats absent
 *
 * The bundle comes first because that is the promise the demo makes: the reader
 * opens without Wi-Fi. Only the extracted article is cached, not the page HTML —
 * a tenth of the bytes and no second extraction on the next open.
 *
 * Rung 3 is new as of 2026-09-01, and it answers everything rung 4 scraped for,
 * the fact-check verdict included. That was the field that looked as though it
 * would need a change at CORRECTIV and did not. Rung 4 stays for two reasons: the
 * REST API is a WordPress feature a plugin can switch off per endpoint, and one on
 * correctiv.org already does that to `wp/v2/users`; and it is the only rung that
 * works on a URL the API does not know, which is every page in the app that is
 * not a post.

 * each that was 24 s to reach an article already on the device, against 12 s
