/**
 * Collecting the offline bundle — the shared half of both apps' build scripts.
 *
 * Each app had its own script that walked the same feeds, picked the top N per
 * feed and extracted each page. They differed in two ways that mattered: one
 * carried a second, hand-written RSS parser next to the core's, and the other
 * only accepted URLs with a date in the path — which silently excluded every
 * Spotlight piece, the articles Home links to most.
 *
 * What stays in the script is the writing — a host wants its bundle in whatever
 * form it can read at runtime, and that has been JSON files in an app folder as well
 * as generated TypeScript modules. That part is genuinely host-specific. This is
 * everything before it.
 *
 * Not used at runtime — the scripts run it under `tsx`.
