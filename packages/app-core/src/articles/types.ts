 * The article model. One of them.
 *
 * There were two: the core's `ArticleDetail` (`topline`, `headline`, `dateText`,
 * `authors` as one string) and the Expo app's `Article` (`kicker`, `title`,
 * `publishedAt`, `authors` as an array). Same pages, same fields, cut
 * differently — which meant two extractors, two reader builders and two rating
 * vocabularies downstream of the difference.
 *
 * This is the merge. Where the two disagreed, the shape that survives is the one
 * that carries more information: an ISO date rather than a printed one (with the
 * printed one kept alongside, because it needs no locale), an author array rather
 * than a string, and a rating that is a closed union rather than any string.

 * and as German prose — so one of the two has to be translated either way.
 * `rating.ts` does that translation in one place.
