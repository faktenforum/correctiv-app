/**
 * `@correctiv/app-core` — the platform-free half of the app.
 *
 * Two hosts share it: `apps/mobile` (NativeScript/Vue) and `apps/mobile-rn`
 * (Expo/React Native, including the web target). It contains the model, the
 * parsers, the services, the caches and all of the state — and imports neither a
 * UI framework nor a platform SDK, which is what a test in `test/boundary.test.ts`
 * enforces on every PR.
 *
 * The root entry exposes only the platform ports, because that is the one thing
 * every host must touch at startup:
 *
 *   import { configurePlatform } from '@correctiv/app-core';
 *
 * Everything else is imported by subpath, mirroring the source layout, so the
 * boundary stays legible at the call site and there are no barrel collisions
 * (`data/interests` versus `stores/interests`):
 *
 *   import { loadArticle } from '@correctiv/app-core/articles/load';
 *   import { formatRelative } from '@correctiv/app-core/lib/format';
 *   import { membershipStore } from '@correctiv/app-core/stores/membership';
 *   import type { Article } from '@correctiv/app-core/articles/types';
