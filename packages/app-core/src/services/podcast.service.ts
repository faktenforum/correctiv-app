 * How much of a show to keep.

 * It was 20, which turned "Pausenbrot" into a taster: that feed carries 439
 * episodes and "Politik" 396. Measured on the live feed, the parsed episodes cost
 * about 0.3 KB each in the cache, so 20 was 6 KB and this is 31 KB per show,
 * and under 200 KB for the seven curated ones, most of which are far shorter.
 * Taking everything would be 127 KB for
 * Pausenbrot alone, for a tail nobody scrolls to.
 *
 * The screen that shows these is a `FlatList` (ADR 0012), so the number of rows
 * costs nothing to render — the ceiling is the cache, not the list.
