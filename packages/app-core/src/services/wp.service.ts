/**
 * correctiv.org through its WordPress REST API.
 *
 * The RSS feeds this replaces cost one request and gave four fields. They also
 * gave no image, no pagination and no `Access-Control-Allow-Origin`, which is why
 * the web build shipped a snapshot of the news instead of the news. Measured on
 * 2026-09-01, all of that turns out to be an RSS property rather than a
 * correctiv.org property:
 *
 * | | RSS | this |
 * | --- | --- | --- |
 * | CORS | no header | reflects the `Origin` |
 * | how many | 100, 10 or 7 per category, fixed | 7,154 posts, paged |
 * | image | none | four named sizes, `thumbnail` to `full` |
 * | verdict | only by scraping the article page | `acf["post::interpretation"]` |
 * | reading time | estimated from the body | as the site prints it |
 * | one card's cost | ~115 KB, the whole article page, for an `og:image` | ~2 KB, everything |
 *
 * That last row is the one that decided it. A list of 20 cards cost about 2.3 MB
 * of HTML, because the only way to find a lead image was to fetch each article
 * page and read its `og:image`. The same 20 cards are 43 KB here, and arrive with
 * the verdict and the byline the RSS path had to guess at or scrape.
 *
 * **Nothing had to change at CORRECTIV for this.** The fields below are already
 * public. Two of them are only reachable because this WordPress exposes plugin
 * output on the post: `acf` (Advanced Custom Fields) carries the fact-check
 * verdict and the kicker, `yoast_head_json` the byline and the printed reading
 * time. WordPress's own `meta` carries neither, which is where the first search
 * looked.
 *
 * What is *not* available, and stays a request to CORRECTIV: `wp/v2/users`
 * answers 401 ("DRA: Only authenticated users can access the REST API"), so
 * author ids cannot be resolved in bulk. `yoast_head_json.author` gives the name
 * per post instead, which is why this reads it there.
