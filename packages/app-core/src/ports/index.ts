 * on its own is declared here as an interface and supplied at startup:
 *
 *   configurePlatform(expoPlatform)   // apps/mobile/src/lib/platform/expo.ts
 *
 * Each port has a session-only or empty default, so an unconfigured core (tests,
 * a script) degrades instead of throwing. Persistence is best-effort everywhere:
 * the blob cache is a nicety, and a lost write costs the last few hundred
 * milliseconds of settings, never correctness.
 *
 * Read `blobs` and `content` as the two halves of "where does content come
 * from": `blobs` is what the app cached from the network, `content` is what the
 * host shipped in its bundle. Neither is required.

/**
 * Small string key/value store — the store persistences in `stores/persist.ts`.
 *
 * Asynchronous, like `BlobStore`. It was synchronous, on the grounds that
 * `persist()` read it while constructing a store, long before anything could
 * await — and a host whose storage is async then had to keep an in-memory mirror
 * and hydrate it before the first render. That cost a documented data-loss trap:
 * read before hydration and the app starts on empty state, then overwrites the
 * real state on the first write.
 *
 * The premise expired with the move to Redux. The store is built by
 * `createAppStore()` at module load; `persist()` is a separate, later call that
 * the host already awaits. So there is nothing left to be earlier than, and the
 * mirror — along with the trap — is gone.

 * feeds, not a settings string, and every caller already sits inside an async

 * with `RangeError: Maximum call stack size exceeded` at the moment the 60-second
 * club preview ran out. The gate called `pause()`, `pause()` emitted, the gate saw
 * an unchanged position and called `pause()` again. Nothing caught it, because
 * expo-audio does not re-enter, so the tests stayed green and the crash only
 * appeared on a device one minute into an episode.
