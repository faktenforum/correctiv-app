 * sends no `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` — so in a browser it does not answer at
 * all. Every one of those is fixed on the REST path. See `services/wp.service.ts`
 * for the measurements.
 *
 * **RSS second, and it is worth keeping.** The two are not two halves of one
 * outage: the REST API is a WordPress feature that a security plugin can switch
 * off per endpoint, and one on correctiv.org already does exactly that to
 * `wp/v2/users`. If the same ever happens to `wp/v2/posts`, this falls back to a
 * path that has served the app for months instead of falling to the snapshot.
 *
 * A feed marked `empty` skips both rounds. `europe` has no category upstream, so
 * asking REST without a `categoryId` would quietly return the whole site under
 * the label "CORRECTIV.Europe".
 *
 * **Throws rather than answering with an empty page**, and the difference is not
 * academic. Returning `{ items: [], hasMore: false }` for a page it cannot serve
 * reads to `loadMore` as "the list ends here": it would bank the page number,
 * clear `hasMore`, and leave "mehr laden" gone until the app restarts, over
 * nothing worse than one timeout. A throw leaves the list exactly as it was. A
 * test asked for page 2 with both rounds failing and caught precisely that.
