 * the reducer, which is what turns "state first, command second" from a rule
 * somebody has to remember into a property of where the code sits.

 * everyone. Both apps used to stop a non-member at 60 seconds and offer the club —
 * dropped on 2026-08-06, which also puts audio in line with "closeness, not a
 * paywall". The `CLUB` badge stays as a label; it no longer withholds anything.
