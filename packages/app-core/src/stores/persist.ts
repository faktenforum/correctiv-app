   * - **Nothing persisted changed → do nothing.** Immer gives a slice a new
   *   identity only when it actually changed, so the comparison is exact and
   *   costs one pointer per slice. Without it, an audio position tick — twice a
   *   second — would re-serialise the saved articles and the membership.
   *
   * - **An armed timer is never postponed.** This is a trailing-edge throttle,
   *   not a debounce, and the difference is the whole point: a debounce resets on
   *   every dispatch, so a burst of unrelated traffic (a pull-to-refresh patches
   *   six feeds, then media, then podcasts) would hold a bookmark the user just
   *   tapped out of storage until the burst ended. Arming on the FIRST change
   *   instead means the write lands 250 ms later no matter what else the app is
