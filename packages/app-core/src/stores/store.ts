/**
 * One Redux store for the whole core.
 *
 * What used to be ten independent observable stores is thirteen slices of one state
 * tree. The slice files kept their names and their public shape — the state
 * interfaces, the pure selectors and the German copy are unchanged — so the only
 * thing that moved is who owns the transition: a reducer now, not a closure over
 * `set`.
 *
 * ## The host constructs it, and there is no singleton here
 *
 * There used to be one, on the grounds that modules which are not components need
 * to reach the same instance the screens are subscribed to. That is no longer true
 * of anything: `media/exclusive-playback.ts` works through callbacks the host
 * registers, and the audio watchdog moved inside the listener middleware, which
 * gets its `dispatch` from the store it belongs to. Every remaining reference to
 * this file inside the core is an `import type`.
 *
 * So the host calls `createAppStore()` once and owns the result. That is what lets
 * it pass enhancers — Redux DevTools, in development — which a store built during
 * this module's evaluation could never have received: there is no moment between
 * "this file is imported" and "the store exists" for anyone to hand something in.
 * It also removes a seam rather than adding one. While the core exported an
 * instance, a test rendering screens against `createAppStore()` would have read
 * one store and written to another, silently.
 *
 * ## Why an audio middleware is installed here
 *
 * `configureStore` is the only place a middleware can go, so the audio store's
 * imperative half — the backend's status listener, the loading watchdog, and the
 * `pause()` that has to follow the error state — is registered from here. It is
 * the audio module's own listener middleware and this file needs nothing else
 * from audio to install it: no audio types, no ports, no knowledge of what it
 * listens for. `stores/audio.ts` explains what each of its entries is for.
 *
 * ## What the dev-mode checks are tuned for
 *
 * Both of RTK's development checks walk the whole state tree on every dispatch,
 * and the audio backend ticks twice a second — two dispatches each, the raw
 * status and the position it reduces to — against a tree holding six feeds,
 * seven podcast series and three video channels. Left at their defaults that is
 * several full traversals a second on the JS thread whenever anything is playing.
 *
 * `immutableCheck` is **off**, because Immer already covers what it would catch.
 * The worry was a reducer mutating one of the bundled offline snapshots that the
 * feed and podcast cascades hand straight into state — but RTK leaves Immer's
 * auto-freeze on, and that throws on exactly that mutation, at the mutation,
 * rather than reporting it one dispatch later.
 *
 * `serializableCheck` stays on, because nothing else catches a Date or a function
 * put into state, and this app deliberately stores timestamps as ISO strings. Its
 * cost is bounded by skipping the three slices that hold network payloads: those
 * are parsed JSON by construction, so they are the least likely to be
 * unserialisable and by far the most expensive to walk.
 *
 * Both are development-only and cost nothing in a release build.
