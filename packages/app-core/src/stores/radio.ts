/**
 * What is on air, as opposed to what this app is playing.
 *
 * Those are two different facts and they live in two different slices. `audio`
 * holds our own player: loading, playing, position, which track. This holds the
 * station: whether a source is connected, how many people are listening, and the
 * title Icecast is announcing. The second is true whether or not the reader ever
 * presses play, which is why it cannot be a field on the first.
 *
 * **It does not poll.** A slice that schedules its own interval keeps the runtime
 * awake for as long as the app lives, and no screen here needs second-by-second
 * accuracy; the Mediathek banner is read once when the screen opens. `fetch` takes
 * `force` so that a caller with a reason — a pull-to-refresh, the moment playback
 * starts — can ask again, and nothing asks on a timer.
