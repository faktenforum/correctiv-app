/**
 * The token bridge: reads the binding design tokens from tokens/theme.css (vendored
 * from wp-design-tokens) and generates the four artefacts this package publishes:
 *
 *   1. theme.css                 the Tailwind v4 theme — the file the app's
 *                                global.css imports, and the one a CMS on
 *                                Tailwind v4 can import unchanged
 *   2. theme.standalone.css      the same, with the `light` / `dark` variant
 *                                definitions spelled out, for a build that has no
 *                                Uniwind to supply them
 *   3. src/tokens.generated.ts   typed constants: both colour schemes, spacing,
 *                                the type scale, radii, durations
 *   4. src/reader.generated.ts   theme.css as a string, plus the dark override block
 *
 * Nothing is written into the app any more. That changed with the move to
 * Uniwind: the previous artefact was a Tailwind v3 theme map, which is what
 * NativeWind is — an engine the app happened to run on, not a property of the
 * tokens. Tailwind v4 takes its theme from CSS, and CSS is portable, so the app
 * and the CMS can read the same file.
 *
 * The typed constants resolve to px, because a React Native style takes numbers.
 * theme.css keeps rem — see the note on that artefact below for why the two units
 * now agree where they used to have to differ. The token repo stays the single
 * source of truth; this script must never produce output that is then hand-edited.
 *
 * ## The shape of this file
 *
 * Six phases, in order, each one a function, so that a change has one obvious place
 * to land. `main()` at the bottom is the whole flow on one screen.
 *
 *   1. parse      tokens/theme.css → a flat map of every --var-* value
 *   2. convert    the unit helpers the two consumers need (rem · px · s)
 *   3. group      that flat map → the token scales, by prefix
 *   4. palette    the second colour scheme, and the checks that must be LOUD
 *   5. render     one function per artefact, each returning a complete string
 *   6. write      the only side effects in the file
 *
 * Nothing here decides how the output LOOKS except the five render functions, and
 * every byte of what they produce is pinned by
 * `apps/mobile/__tests__/tokens.test.ts`, which regenerates all four artefacts
 * and byte-compares them against the committed copies. Restructuring this script is
 * safe exactly to the extent that check is.
 *
 * Run:  npm run tokens

 * symptom of its own: it stays on its light value in dark mode, in a build that is
 * otherwise green, and is noticed when someone opens the app on a dark phone and
 * finds one card the wrong colour. So a colour in neither list THROWS rather than
 * defaulting either way, and the message says what the choice is — because that
 * choice, "is this a value or a role", is the only thing the generator cannot make
 * for itself.
 *
 * `schemeIndependent` is what makes throwing affordable. Without it the check could
 * only demand a dark value for every colour, and eleven primitives that genuinely
 * must not move would each need a redundant entry restating its light value — at
 * which point the entries stop being decisions and the check stops being read.
 *
 * Uniwind needs the same guarantee from the other end: it refuses a pair of
 * `@variant` blocks that do not declare the same set of variables. Since both blocks
 * are built from these lists, satisfying this satisfies that.

 * theme.css — the Tailwind v4 theme, and the artefact the other three are

 *
 * Two CSS files, because two consumers need different amounts of scaffolding.
 *
 *   theme.css             the tokens. What the app imports; Uniwind supplies the
 *                         `light` / `dark` variant definitions it needs.
 *   theme.standalone.css  the same, with those definitions included. What a
 *                         consumer outside this repo imports — a WordPress theme
 *                         on Tailwind v4, which has no Uniwind to supply them.
 *
 * The split exists so the app does not shadow Uniwind's own definitions with a
 * second copy of them. Without the standalone file, `theme.css` alone fails on a
 * plain Tailwind v4 build with `Cannot use @variant with unknown variant: light`.
 *
 * Values stay in `rem` here, unlike the px in the typed constants below. Uniwind
 * resolves rem against 16 (`--uniwind-em`), which is both the CSS convention and
 * the base wp-design-tokens assumes, so the app lands on exactly the same pixels
 * — while a browser keeps the user's font scaling, which a px value would throw
 * away. This is why one set of values can serve both consumers; under NativeWind
 * it could not, because that inlined rem against a root size of 14.
 *
 * They sit at the package ROOT because that is where a CSS entry conventionally
 * lives; `src/` is for what TypeScript imports. Both are named explicitly in the
 * `exports` map, and a bare subpath resolves for Uniwind and for the plain
 * Tailwind CLI alike — an earlier note here claimed the CLI ignores exports maps,
 * which is simply not true and was a bad test on my part.
 *
 * ## Why the palette appears three times
 *
 * `@theme` registers the colour names — that is what makes `bg-grey-100` exist as
 * a utility at all — and gives them their light values, so a consumer that never
 * switches themes is already correct. The two `@variant` blocks then carry the
 * per-theme values: Uniwind scans for exactly these to learn which variables are
 * theme-dependent, and both blocks must declare the SAME set or it refuses. The
 * two checks in phase 4 already guarantee that.
 *
 * The upshot is that dark mode needs no `dark:` variant on any surface:
 * `bg-grey-100` resolves a variable, redefined under both the `.dark` class and
 * `prefers-color-scheme: dark`.
