# Emulator images volunteer things. A round of this set came back with an Android
# stylus-handwriting sheet covering the search screen: the tap had succeeded, so the
# tour reported no MISS, and the shot documented a system dialog with the app greyed
# out behind it. That is the 83-video failure in a new costume — a step can be wrong
# without being missing — so the features that pop unasked are turned off before a
# tour starts rather than dismissed after one goes wrong.
# Called by each tour, NOT on sourcing. It presses BACK, and sourcing this file to
# poke at a device by hand then backs out of whatever was open — on the onboarding
# that leaves the app, which looks exactly like the app crashing.
