/**
 * The plugin's files, kept current where Figma reads them.
 *
 * On Linux the flatpak can only read a directory it was granted, so the plugin runs
 * from a COPY outside this repository (`fix-plugin-path.mjs` says why). That copy
 * goes stale in silence, and the plugin is an interpreter: a stale one draws a
 * description with a vocabulary it does not have yet, and the symptom is a board
 * that quietly misses whatever the new word said. It happened on 2026-09-10 — three
 * interpreter changes were committed, the copy was not refreshed, the plugin was
 * restarted, and its summary still reported the old component count.
 *
 * `fix-plugin-path.mjs` copies too, and having to remember to run it is what failed.
 * This runs on the way to serving anything, which is the one thing nobody forgets.
 * A `code.js` change still needs the plugin closed and reopened; the line below says
 * so, because only a person can do that.
