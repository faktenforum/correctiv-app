# Release & CI

Three GitHub Actions workflows live in `.github/workflows/`:

| Workflow | File | Trigger | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **CI** | `ci.yml` | every PR, push to `main` | Checks, web export, and an Android release APK as a compile check. No secrets needed. |
| **Pages** | `pages.yml` | push to `main` (or manual) | Rebuilds the Expo web export under the Pages base path and publishes it to <https://faktenforum.github.io/correctiv-app/>. No secrets needed. |
| **Release Android** | `release-android.yml` | push of a `v*` tag (or manual) | Builds the APK and signs it, with your upload key when the secrets are set and otherwise with the bundled **test key**. Attaches it to the GitHub Release. |

## The web preview

A web version of the app at <https://faktenforum.github.io/correctiv-app/preview.html>,
for clicking through without an install. Every push to `main` republishes it; there is
nothing to tag and nothing to commit. Three things are worth knowing before pointing
anyone at the URL:

- **Hand out the `/preview.html` address, not the bare one.** The app is built for a
  phone and has no desktop layout, so the site's root shows it stretched across the
  whole browser window; `/preview.html` frames it at a phone or tablet size instead.
  The root stays reachable, nothing hides it, so the framed link is the one to
  send.
- **Its articles are live**, since [ADR 0015](adr/0015-reading-correctiv-org-through-its-rest-api.md).
  This bullet used to say they were as old as the last `npm run offline-articles`,
  because a browser cannot reach an RSS feed for want of a CORS header. The app reads
  the REST API now, which sends one. The bundled snapshot is still there and still
  worth refreshing before a demo, because it is what the page falls back to when a
  request fails, and it is what an offline reader sees.
- **It opens on the door.** Since
  [ADR 0016](adr/0016-a-door-at-the-root-and-an-entitlement-not-an-amount.md) the app
  is for members whose membership includes it, and the published copy starts signed
  out. Sign-in is simulated and the screen prints the rules: any address gets in, one
  containing "frei" shows the upgrade state. `preview.html#/?s=signed-in` skips the
  form, `s=onboarded` lands on Home.
- **The site is a project site**, served from `/correctiv-app/`, so the export needs
  `EXPO_BASE_URL` to prefix its asset URLs. `pages.yml` takes that value from
  `actions/configure-pages` and asserts it reached the built HTML. The failure is
  otherwise invisible until the site is live and blank.

Pages was previously served straight off `main:/docs`. Pointing it at this workflow
instead is a **repository setting**, made once and not by the workflow itself.
`actions/configure-pages` reads an existing site but never changes its build type:

```bash
gh api -X POST repos/faktenforum/correctiv-app/pages -f build_type=workflow
# or: Settings → Pages → Build and deployment → Source: GitHub Actions
```

Until that is done, the deploy step fails with *"Not configured to use GitHub
Actions"*. The build and every assertion above it still run, so the failure is
loud and specific rather than a silently stale site.

## Cutting a release

```bash
git tag v1.2.3
git push origin v1.2.3
```

This creates a GitHub Release for the tag with auto-generated notes and attaches
`correctiv-app-v1.2.3.apk`.

The tag also drives the app version: `vX.Y.Z` becomes `versionName X.Y.Z`, and the
workflow run number becomes the `versionCode` (Play requires it to increase on every
upload). `apps/mobile/app.json` is patched only inside CI. The change is not
committed.

The APK is re-signed after Gradle builds it. Gradle signs the release variant with
the Expo template's debug key, which is **generated per machine**: two builds of the
same commit would carry two identities, and a tester could not install one over the
other. `apksigner` replaces that signature with a stable one, either the test key or your
upload key when the secrets are set.

## Signing modes

The release build works **with or without** your own signing key:

| | Secrets set? | Output | Use |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Real release** | yes | APK **+ AAB**, signed with your upload key | Google Play + sideloading |
| **Test fallback** | no | APK only, signed with the in-repo **test key** (`signing/`) | Sideloading / sharing test builds |

The test fallback needs no setup. Every `v*` tag (or manual run) produces an
installable, consistently-signed test APK (clearly marked as a test build). It must
never go to the Play Store. To produce real releases, add the secrets below.

## Switching to real (Play Store) releases

For Play-ready releases, set up your own **upload keystore** and four repository
secrets. Without them the workflow falls back to the test key described above.

### 1. Create an upload keystore (if you don't have one yet)

```bash
keytool -genkeypair -v \
  -keystore correctiv-upload.jks \
  -alias correctiv-upload \
  -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000
```

Keep this file and its passwords safe. Losing it means you can no longer update the
app on Google Play. Do **not** commit it.

### 2. Add the secrets

Replace the values, then run (requires the GitHub CLI, `gh auth login`):

```bash
base64 -w0 correctiv-upload.jks > keystore.b64

gh secret set ANDROID_KEYSTORE_BASE64   < keystore.b64
gh secret set ANDROID_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD --body 'your-keystore-password'
gh secret set ANDROID_KEY_ALIAS         --body 'correctiv-upload'
gh secret set ANDROID_KEY_PASSWORD      --body 'your-key-password'

rm keystore.b64
```

(Or add them via GitHub → Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions.)

## Testing the pipeline without a release

Run the **Release Android** workflow manually (Actions tab → Run workflow, or
`gh workflow run release-android.yml`). It builds the APK and uploads it to the run
as an artifact, without creating a release. No secrets required, because it uses the test key.

Done once on 2026-08-06 from `9842b27`
([run 31105467974](https://github.com/faktenforum/correctiv-app/actions/runs/31105467974)).
The build job green, the artifact on the run, the test-key fallback taken because no
`ANDROID_KEYSTORE_*` secrets are set (a workflow warning, an APK, no AAB), and the
attach job correctly skipped without a tag. The APK carries
`CN=CORRECTIV App TEST KEY (not for Play)` and verifies under signature schemes v2 and
v3, so it installs on everything the app supports (`minSdkVersion 24`).

A tagless run cannot cover the two `Set version from tag` steps or the attach job,
since all three are `if:` a tag. The version steps were checked by running them
verbatim against the real files with `GITHUB_REF_NAME=v1.2.3` and
`GITHUB_RUN_NUMBER=47`. `app.gradle` went to `versionCode 47` and
`versionName "1.2.3"`, and `app.json` to `version 1.2.3` with `android.versionCode 47`,
keeping `package`, the adaptive icon and the permissions. Both `sed` patterns matched,
which is worth checking: a `sed` that matches nothing changes nothing and says so
nowhere.

`apksigner` writes a v4 `.apk.idsig` next to the APK, so it rides along in the run
artifact. It cannot reach a GitHub Release, because that step globs `*.apk` and
`*.aab`.

## What the first real tag proved

[`v0.0.3`](https://github.com/faktenforum/correctiv-app/releases/tag/v0.0.3), tagged on
2026-08-12 from `0d97483`
([run 31569569194](https://github.com/faktenforum/correctiv-app/actions/runs/31569569194)),
closes both gaps.

The tag drove the version, read off the downloaded asset rather than the run log:
`aapt2 dump badging` reports `versionName='0.0.3' versionCode='7'`, the `versionCode`
being the run number. Attaching works. The
certificate is the same one as the dry run, so re-signing holds across a tagged build
too.

And the released APK runs, which is the claim a release page cannot make: `adb install
-r` over an older build succeeded on an API 36 emulator, the app started, and Home
rendered with a live feed and the date header the core formats.

Two things the workflow does not do. The release body's note about which build this is
was added afterwards with `gh release edit`, and nothing about a release is committed.
The version patches live only inside the run.

## iOS (not yet wired up)

iOS requires a macOS runner plus Apple code-signing (Apple Developer Program,
distribution certificate, provisioning profile) and is distributed via TestFlight
rather than as a downloadable file. A separate workflow can be added once the Apple
Developer account is available.
