/**
 * Exact-match redirects. A bare specifier this application answers itself.
 *
 * NOT `--dialect react-native`, and that is the one genuinely awkward decision in this
 * build. The flag aliases `react-native` onto `@gjsify/react-native` and adds ADR 0032
 * section 8's build-time support gate, which is worth having — but its alias plugin is
 * `pre`, so it would also win over the redirect below, and this application needs a
 * layer in between: 110 call sites pass props the GTK layer refuses by name
 * (`hitSlop`, the five accessibility props, `pointerEvents="box-none"`), and
 * `src/shims/react-native.tsx` is where each gets ONE deliberate answer instead of 110
 * render-time throws.
 *
 * The gate is not given up. `test/support-gate.test.ts` reproduces it against the same
 * published support table, over this application's own source.
 *
 * It reproduces the IMPORT half only. This comment claimed the props half too, and that
 * was never true of either gate: a refused prop is a render-time throw per screen, and
 * three `<Typo onPress>` in `(tabs)/profil.tsx` went through this build, the typecheck
 * and that test green before ending the whole tree at startup. The test's own header
 * says what it does not cover, and names `@gjsify/react-native/prop-table` as what
 * closes it.

 * paths, "both of which guess an extension" (ADR 0010). Nothing guesses once a
 * redirect has produced an absolute path, so this guesses.
 *
 * `.gtk.*` comes first, which is ADR 0032 section 9's platform chain: a
 * `Foo.gtk.tsx` beside a `Foo.tsx` wins on this host. Nothing uses it yet, and it
 * costs one array entry to leave the door open.
 *
 * The middle rung is the OS one, and leaving it out was a hole rather than a thrift.
 * gjsify's own `platformResolvePlugin` searches `['gtk', <os>, 'desktop']` — but it
 * answers RELATIVE imports only, and this plugin runs at `order: 'pre'`, so it wins for
 * every specifier the redirects above produce: every `@/…`, `@correctiv/app-core/…`,
 * `@correctiv/design-tokens/…`. Without the rung a `Foo.macos.tsx` beside a `Foo.tsx`
 * was INVISIBLE, with no error — and that shape is exactly what the macOS WebView needs,
 * so the hole was about to be stepped in.
 *
 * Order is load-bearing: `.gtk` → `.<os>` → `.desktop` → bare, most specific host first.
 * `.native` and `.web` stay OUT — they belong to Metro and to the web target, and
 * gjsify's own chain refuses them by name for the same reason.

 * hoisting means one copy in the tree and nothing to decide. `scripts/gjsify-link.mjs`
 * breaks that: a linked package's real path is inside the gjsify checkout, so every
 * bare specifier it names resolves through THAT tree's `node_modules`, where a second
 * `react` is installed as a devDependency. Two Reacts in one bundle, and the failure
 * is not a duplicate-module warning:
 *
 *     TypeError: can't access property "useMemo", z.H is null
 *
 * `H` is the hooks dispatcher on React's shared internals. The component was rendered
 * by one copy and read its hooks off the other, whose dispatcher is null outside a
 * render. It cost one build to find and reads like a bug in the layer.
 *
 * WHY THE LIST IS READ RATHER THAN WRITTEN. The names come from the layer's own
 * `peerDependencies`, so a peer gjsify adds is deduped the day it is added. A copy of
 * the list here would be a second truth, and the failure it produces is this one.
 *
 * Unresolvable names are skipped rather than reported: `solid-js` is a peer of that
 * package and this application does not use the Solid binding, so there is nothing to
 * pin and nothing wrong.
