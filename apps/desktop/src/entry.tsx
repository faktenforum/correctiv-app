// The desktop entry point.
//
// ## The ordering constraint, which is the whole content of this file
//
// Three things have to happen and two of them cannot happen at module scope:
//
//   1. `registerBuiltinWidgets()` — the GTK widget table the reconciler resolves tags
//      against. Pure data, safe at import.
//   2. `configureStyle({ tokens, sheet })` — must run BEFORE the first styled element
//      renders, because the class compiler resolves `bg-grey-100` against the token
//      scale when it MINTS the class. Configure it late and every class already minted
//      resolved against `MINIMAL_TOKENS`.
//   3. `registerRootComponent` — builds the `Adw.ApplicationWindow` and renders into it.
//
// Step 2 cannot go above step 3, and finding that out is the reason this file has a
// comment instead of three lines. `StyleSheet` constructs a `Gtk.CssProvider` and
// installs it on the DEFAULT `Gdk.Display`, and `Adw.StyleManager.get_default()` wants
// the same display — neither exists until `Gtk.init()`, which `AppRegistry` calls
// inside the application's `activate`. Doing it at module scope aborts the process
// before any of it: `Gdk-ERROR **: gdk_display_manager_get() was called before
// gtk_init()`, SIGABRT and a core dump, measured.
//
// So it happens at the top of the root component's first render, which
// `AppRegistry.runApplication` reaches only after the window exists — and still before
// any child of it has rendered a single class.
//
// ## The palette is chosen once, here
//
// `Adw.StyleManager:dark` is what the user is actually looking at, as opposed to
// `color-scheme`, which is what the application asked for. Reading it picks one of the
// two generated token scales, so `bg-grey-100` is a white page surface in light and
// `#1a1a1a` in dark — the same two palettes the phone and the web target use, from the
// same generated file.
//
// It is read ONCE per launch, and that is this host's one real divergence from the
// phone, where the same setting flips both halves live. `configureStyle` installs a
// module-level scale and the sheet mints a class per declaration set, so
// re-configuring mid-session would change what NEW classes resolve to while every
// widget already on screen kept the class it was given — half the window in each
// scheme. Adwaita's own chrome still follows the setting immediately (see
// `shims/uniwind.ts`); the app's token colours need a restart. Named here, in that
// shim, and in README.md.

// Version-pinned, like every other `gi://` import in this tree — and it replaces an
// `imports.gi.Adw` that resolved UNVERSIONED. On GJS that read the one Adw the process
// had; through `@gjsify/node-gi`'s `imports` proxy it became `requireGi('Adw',
// undefined)`, an unversioned namespace resolution, which is the hazard the WebView
// shim's own header spells out in capitals for WebKit. Importing the module here is
// safe; only the display-dependent READ below must stay inside its guard.

/**
 * Give libadwaita the BRAND accent, so its own widgets are CORRECTIV red.
 *
 * Without this the mini player's play button is Adwaita's `.suggested-action` blue two
 * rows under a brand-red LIVE banner. `Adw.AccentColor` is an enum of nine named
 * colours and cannot carry a brand — but it is only how an app READS the system's
 * choice. The accent reaches widgets as CSS, so an app can define it.
 *
 * ## Only the BACKGROUND accent, and that is the whole design
 *
 * libadwaita keeps two: `--accent-bg-color`, which a `.suggested-action` button is
 * painted with, and the standalone `--accent-color`, which accent-coloured TEXT uses
 * and which has to stay legible on the window. Setting both is the obvious move and is
 * WRONG — it would have shipped an accessibility regression. MEASURED with
 * `debug/accent-probe.ts`, giving it only `--accent-bg-color: #ff5c5c` and reading a
 * resolved standalone accent:
 *
 *     dark scheme    1.231 0.570 0.551   lightened, for a dark window
 *     light scheme   0.730 0.033 0.138   darkened, for a light one
 *
 * Adwaita derives it per scheme and does the contrast work in both directions. Setting
 * `--accent-color` to the app's own token instead pins one value — the same red the
 * app draws accent TEXT in — and in light mode that is a pale red on white.
 *
 * `--accent-fg-color` is left alone too, but for a weaker reason, said plainly: the
 * on-accent foreground read white both before and after in every measurement, so it
 * did not need setting for THIS colour. Whether Adwaita would flip it to black for a
 * pale accent is not measured here.
 *
 * ## A second provider, which the sheet's own docblock argues against
 *
 * `style/sheet.ts` keeps one provider so that a minted class cannot be shadowed by a
 * rule at another priority. That argument is about CLASSES, and `StyleSheet` exposes
 * only `classFor(declarations)` — there is no API for a rule with a `:root` selector.
 * The two providers therefore touch disjoint selectors and cannot shadow each other;
 * what it costs is a second entry in the GTK inspector.
 *
 * ## Per scheme, from the app's own scale
 *
 * The accent token differs between the two — `rgb(255 80 100)` light, `rgb(255 97 115)`
 * dark — so this reads the same scale every class in the app resolves against rather
 * than hard-coding a hex. It runs after the preference has been applied and `dark`
 * read, so it agrees with the palette by construction; like that read, it is once per
 * launch and needs the restart the header describes.

 * Put the two brand faces on the font map, and say what happened.
 *
 * The faces are staged into `data/fonts/` by `scripts/stage-fonts.mjs` and declared
 * to `gjsify ship` as `gjsify.ship.fonts`; the launcher exports `GJSIFY_FONT_DIR` at
 * wherever that directory ended up, because only the launcher knows whether the
 * payload became `/usr`, a `Contents/Resources` or `C:\Program Files`. `initFonts()`
 * reads that variable itself. `scripts/start.mjs` sets it for a dev run so the two
 * paths do not diverge.
 *
 * ## Why this LOGS instead of asserting
 *
 * The outcome is legitimately different on each platform, and only one of the three
 * shapes is a defect:
 *
 *   * **registered** — a fontconfig-backed Pango took the faces. Linux, and Windows.
 *   * **declined** — `pango_font_map_add_font_file()` is a vfunc and the CoreText map
 *     implements none, so macOS answers `G_IO_ERROR_NOT_SUPPORTED`. That is not a
 *     failure: a `.app` carries `ATSApplicationFontsPath`, so the OS activated the
 *     staged directory before this process started and the faces are already there.
 *     The corollary is worth knowing while developing: running the bundle directly on
 *     macOS, outside a `.app`, has no brand typeface and cannot have one.
 *   * **failed** — a face the map refused for any other reason. This one is ours.
 *
 * An assertion would have to encode all three, and would then be wrong on the next
 * platform. Pango's own failure mode is the reason there is any output at all: it does
 * not report a missing family, so `set_family('Merriweather')` against a map that
 * never got the file resolves to the default sans and nothing anywhere says a word.
