// Reconcile the families this app asks for against the ones the running font map has.
//
// ## Why this is not a lookup table
//
// The same byte-identical face registers under a different family name depending on
// which font stack reads its naming table. Measured on two machines against the same
// SHA-256:
//
//   Linux   (fontconfig)  Merriweather_400Regular.ttf -> "Merriweather"
//   Windows (gvsbuild)    Merriweather_400Regular.ttf -> "Merriweather 18pt"
//
// Google Fonts ships Merriweather as an optical-size family and the two readers
// disagree about whether the size axis belongs in the family name. `Source Sans 3` has
// no such axis and reads identically on both, which is what makes the difference look
// like a broken font rather than a naming convention.
//
// Both were reported as registered. `pango_font_map_add_font_file()` answered success
// for all five faces on Windows, and `Merriweather` still was not on the map — so the
// registration call cannot be the thing that is checked. Only the map can answer, which
// is the same reason `debug/font-probe.ts` exists.
//
// ## Why it runs before the first render
//
// The class compiler bakes the family into the minted class, so a name corrected after
// the first `<Text>` would leave earlier widgets asking for a family nothing has. This
// runs in `entry.tsx` beside `configureStyleOnce()`, for the same reason.
