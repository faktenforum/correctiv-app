// The app's loaded-family names, and the two axes GTK actually has behind each.
//
// ## Why this is a map and not a pass-through
//
// `lib/theme/fonts.ts` names one loaded family per CUT — `Merriweather_700Bold`, not
// `Merriweather` at weight 700 — and says why: Android ignores `fontWeight` on a
// custom font, so the weight has to travel inside the family name. The consequence
// reaches here: `buildStyle()` in `lib/theme/typography.ts` emits `fontFamily` and
// **no `fontWeight` at all**, for every one of the typography variants.
//
// Pango has never heard of those names. A `.ttf` handed to a font map declares its
// own family and its own weight, and `Merriweather_700Bold` is neither — so asking
// for it gets the default sans back. That is the failure this file exists to make
// impossible, and it is worth spelling out because it does not look like a failure:
// Pango does not report a missing family. The window draws, the text is legible and
// correctly laid out, the process exits 0, and the app is wearing the wrong typeface.
//
// So each name is split back into the family and the weight. The values are read off
// the files with `fc-query`, not derived from their names:
//
//   Merriweather_400Regular   Merriweather     Regular   400
//   Merriweather_700Bold      Merriweather     Bold      700
//   SourceSans3_400Regular    Source Sans 3    Regular   400
//   SourceSans3_600SemiBold   Source Sans 3    SemiBold  600
//   SourceSans3_700Bold       Source Sans 3    Bold      700
//
// Note `Source Sans 3` carries spaces, and that is not a cosmetic detail. The first
// version of this comment claimed the family reaches GTK as a widget property, so no
// quoting question arose. It does not: it is written into a generated CSS rule, and
// `font-family: Source Sans 3` makes GTK refuse the whole rule. The shim quotes it
// until gjsify #1539 does so in the emitter. The family is stored as data here for
// the same reason — it cannot be reconstructed from the asset name.
//
// ## One table, three readers
//
// This table is the single source of truth for three things that must agree, and
// the whole point is that they cannot drift apart silently:
//
//   1. `scripts/stage-fonts.mjs` stages exactly these files into `data/fonts/`.
//   2. `shims/react-native.tsx` resolves `fontFamily` through `fontCutFor()`.
//   3. `test/fonts.test.ts` asserts the table against `lib/theme/fonts.ts` in BOTH
//      directions — every name the app can produce is here, and every entry here is
//      a name the app can produce.
//
// Direction 2 of that test is the one that earns its keep. A missing entry is a
// substituted typeface, which nothing reports; a surplus entry is a face that ships
// for no reason, which nothing reports either.

 * A family name as it must appear in a generated GTK CSS rule.

 * shim so that a test can hold it. `@gjsify/gtk-host`'s style layer writes the value
 * into the rule verbatim — so `font-family: Source Sans 3` makes GTK refuse the WHOLE
 * rule ("Junk at end of value for font-family"), the layer's own `assertContained`
 * guard throws `StyleSheetError`, and no React boundary catches it. The screen is gone.
 * Measured on GJS with both families verifiably on Pango's font map, so the fault is the
 * CSS and not the font.
 *
 * THE REASON IS NOT THE SPACE, and getting that wrong is worth recording because this
 * comment did. A bare sequence of identifiers IS legal CSS and GTK implements it, so
 * `Noto Sans`, `DejaVu Sans` and `Fira Code` all parse unquoted. What GTK refuses is a
 * component that is not a valid identifier — overwhelmingly one starting with a DIGIT.
 * `Source Sans 3` fails on the `3`, not on the spaces. Measured against GTK's own parser
 * while reviewing the upstream fix, which corrected the issue this file's author filed.
 *
 * Quoting on a space is therefore a superset of what is needed: right for this app's two
 * families, and it would still miss a one-word `8514oem`. That is acceptable only because
 * the set is closed and asserted — `FONT_FAMILIES` is two names and a test holds it.
 *
 * fixed upstream in gjsify: #1539 quotes it in the emitter, where it belongs, and
 * leaves an already-quoted value alone — so this stays harmless until the next bump
 * removes it and the test below with it.
