// A video pipeline, seen as an MPRIS source.
//
// ## Why this one reads the stream and the audio one reads the store
//
// They are not inconsistent, they are two different architectures underneath. Audio
// playback is OWNED by the core: `@correctiv/app-core/stores/audio` holds the intent,
// the backend reports, and a command that bypassed the store would desync it. Video
// playback is owned by `video/stream.ts` — the screen drives a `Gtk.MediaStream`
// directly and the core's video slice knows only WHICH video is on screen, not whether
// it is running. So the truth about playing/position/duration is the stream, and the
// truth about the title is the store, and this file joins them.
//
// ## Microseconds all the way through, for once
//
// `Gtk.MediaStream:timestamp` and `:duration` are microseconds, which is also MPRIS's
// unit. Nothing here converts, and that is worth a sentence only because every other
// seam in this app has to: the core's audio store is in seconds and GStreamer is in
// nanoseconds.
