// The core's audio store, seen as an MPRIS source.
//
// ## Why the store and not `audio/backend.ts`
//
// The backend is closer to the pipeline and would be the shorter wire, and it is the
// wrong end. `AudioBackend`'s own docblock records what happens when the two sides of
// that port disagree: the core keeps its own intent beside the backend's reported
// state, and a `Pause` arriving straight at GStreamer would leave the store believing
// it was still playing — the same class of desync that once cost a
// `RangeError: Maximum call stack size exceeded` a minute into an episode.
//
// So a shell's button dispatches the same thunk the app's own play button dispatches,
// and the store stays the single record of what the user asked for. The metadata comes
// from the same place, which is also where `nowPlaying` was going all along.
//
// ## The tick is the store's, not another timer
//
// `coreStore.subscribe` fires on every dispatch, and the audio store already receives
// a status tick every 500 ms from the backend. MPRIS therefore needs no timer of its
// own: `changed()` diffs against the last published snapshot and emits nothing when
// nothing moved, which is what keeps a 2 Hz tick from becoming 2 Hz of bus traffic.
// `Position` is deliberately outside that diff — the spec keeps it out of
// `PropertiesChanged` and a shell reads it when it wants it.

 * which from `loading` reaches `audio.play()` — a harmless no-op on something already
 * opening. Reported as "Playing" the shell would offer Pause, and `togglePlay` from
 * `loading` does NOT pause, so that press would do nothing at all. Both are brief;
 * only one of them has a button that means what it says.
 *
 * `error` is `Stopped` rather than something more specific because MPRIS has no error
 * state, and leaving it at `Paused` would offer a Play button for a stream that has
