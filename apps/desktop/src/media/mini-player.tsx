// The now-playing strip above the tabs — as Adwaita widgets, not as a redrawn phone.
//
// ## Why this is not `components/player/MiniPlayer`
//
// The phone's strip is a `View` with a `Pressable`, a round accent circle and two
// `Typo`s, and every one of those would come through the shims as a `Gtk.Box` with a
// minted CSS class. That works, and it produces a GNOME window with a React Native
// bar in it. GTK already HAS this widget vocabulary: `.toolbar` is Adwaita's own style
// class for exactly this strip, `.circular` and `.suggested-action` are what a play
// button wears, `.heading` and `.caption dim-label` are the title/subtitle pair. So
// this is built from those instead, and it inherits the platform's padding, focus
// rings, hover states and dark-mode colours rather than restating them.
//
// The STATE is shared: the core's audio slice, the same selectors the phone's strip
// uses, and the same actions. Only the drawing is native.
//
// ## Where it renders
//
// `<Tabs bottomBar={…}>`, which is a seam that did not exist until gjsify#1617: the
// switcher is created with `slot: 'title'` and resolves against the PARENT, so a box
// placed between the tab layout and the header bar takes the switcher's slot away.
// With the prop, `Adw.ToolbarView` carries this bar and the view switcher bar
// together, and the router renders this one FIRST — measured on libadwaita 1.9.3, the
// first-added bottom bar sits closer to the content, so this lands above the tabs
// exactly as it does on the phone.
//
// ## Nothing playing costs nothing
//
// This returns `null` when there is no track, and the router's wrapper box is then an
// empty bottom bar. MEASURED: an empty `Gtk.Box` as a bottom bar takes no height and
// the view stack above it is allocated identically — so the strip is absent rather
// than a collapsed remnant, with no `reveal` animation to arrange.
//
// ## What the phone has here and this does not
//
// NO ARTWORK. The phone's strip has none either, so this is parity rather than a gap —
// noted only because MPRIS does publish `mpris:artUrl`, and the shell's own media
// widget therefore shows a cover this bar does not.

          blue — measured, `Adw.StyleManager.accentColor` is 0 (BLUE) with
          `systemSupportsAccentColors` true on libadwaita 1.9.3. So the button does NOT
          match the brand red the banner above it uses, and it is left that way on
          purpose: a GNOME application follows the accent its user chose.

          ~~The brand red is not available anyway, because `Adw.AccentColor` is an
          enum.~~ IT IS AVAILABLE — that enum is for READING the system's choice, and
          the accent reaches widgets as CSS. MEASURED with `debug/accent-probe.ts`: a
          provider setting `:root { --accent-color: #ff5c5c }` moves a resolved accent
          reading from the system blue to exactly `1.000 0.361 0.361`, the requested
          colour. So this is a real choice between following the user and branding the
