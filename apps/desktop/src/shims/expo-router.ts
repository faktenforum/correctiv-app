// `expo-router`, over `@gjsify/react-native/router`.
//
// The `--dialect react-native` build aliases the bare `react-native` specifier and
// nothing else, so this one is ours to point somewhere. The router package already IS
// the expo-router surface over `@react-navigation/core`, and the app uses exactly the
// four names it supports — `router` (19 calls), `useLocalSearchParams` (7),
// `usePathname` (1) and `Stack` (1) — plus `Tabs`, which this host's own tab layout uses.
//
// Everything else expo-router exports is deliberately absent rather than stubbed. An
// import of `Link` or `Redirect` should fail at the build, where the support table can
// say what the plan for it is; a stub would make it fail in the window.
//
// ## The one thing that is an adapter rather than a re-export
//
// `router.push` in `@gjsify/react-native/router` takes `(href: string)`. expo-router's
// takes a `Href`, which is EITHER a string OR `{ pathname, params }` — and this app uses
// both forms, at ten call sites across seven pathnames:
//
//   router.push({ pathname: '/artikel', params: { url } })          a query parameter
//   router.push({ pathname: '/projekt/[id]', params: { id } })      a path parameter
//
// Handing the object straight through would not fail the build (nothing typechecks the
// bundle) and would not throw at runtime either — it would be interpolated into a URL as
// `[object Object]`, so every parameterised navigation in the app would quietly land on
// the not-found route. That is exactly the silent-failure shape this port exists to
// refuse, so the two forms are converted here.
//
// fixed upstream in gjsify: `router.push`/`replace`/`navigate` should accept
// expo-router's object `Href` — remove `hrefOf` and the wrapper below on the next bump.

   * own `SET_PARAMS` writes that same route object, so both halves keep agreeing.

   * `SET_PARAMS` at whichever navigator sees it first — the root — and would set the
