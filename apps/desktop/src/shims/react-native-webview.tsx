// `react-native-webview`, backed by WebKitGTK through `gi://WebKit?version=6.0`.
//
// This is the one shim that is a real engine rather than a mapping, and it is the
// reason the reader works at all: `buildReaderHtml` in the core produces a complete,
// self-contained HTML document — structure, class names, German copy, the verdict
// plaque, the token CSS and the base64-embedded fonts — and every host's job is
// simply to display it. WebKitGTK displays it, so the article looks the same here as
// it does on the phone, fonts included.
//
// `gi://WebKit?version=6.0` is the same specifier `@gjsify/iframe` uses. THE VERSION
// IS NOT OPTIONAL: this machine also has `WebKit2-4.1.typelib` installed, which is
// the GTK3 build. Importing it into a GTK4 process is two toolkits in one address
// space, and the failure is a crash rather than a diagnostic.
//
// ## Why the widget is attached imperatively rather than rendered as an element
//
// `WebKit.WebView` is not in gtk-host's builtin widget table, and it has no React
// Native counterpart to route through L2. It could be registered with
// `registerWidget`, and that would buy nothing here: the element has no children, no
// styleable class list this app uses, and three props that are all imperative calls
// underneath (`load_html`, a policy signal, a script-message handler). So the
// component renders a `View` — a real `Gtk.Box` this layer owns and lays out — and
// puts the web view inside it through the `ref`, which on this host hands back the
// author's own `Gtk.Widget` rather than a wrapper.
//
// ## Two injected scripts, and why each one is not a signal
//
// WebKit emits no scroll signal: the scroll position lives inside the web process.
// `onScroll` is therefore driven by a user script that posts `window.scrollY` through
// a `WebKit.UserContentManager` message handler. That is the documented channel for
// exactly this, and it costs one message per scroll event rather than a polling
// timer.
//
// The navigation gate is injected for a different reason: `decide-policy` exists only
// on WebKitGTK. On macOS this namespace is a WKWebView behind a GObject shim with three
// signals and not that one, and on Windows there is no WebKit at all — so a
// signal-only gate is a gate the reader silently loses on both hosts this app is being
// ported to. The click interception is the mechanism the WEB target already uses for
// the same absence, so all three non-GTK hosts now behave identically. Details and the
// non-overlap argument sit on `NAVIGATE_SCRIPT` below.
//
// It also means the reader document runs script on this host, where on the web target
// it deliberately does not (`ReaderView.web.tsx` withholds `allow-scripts` and
// listens from the parent instead, because `srcDoc` keeps the frame same-origin). The
// difference is named here because it is a real widening of what the article document
// may do: two injected scripts of ours, plus whatever the document itself carries.
// Narrowing it is now HARDER than it was, and the trade is worth stating: a WebKit
// settings pass (`enable-javascript: false`) would have cost only the scroll channel
// before, and would now cost the navigation gate too — on the hosts that have no
// `decide-policy` to fall back on, that is the whole gate. Worth doing before this is
// anything but a demo, and it needs a different answer than "turn script off".

// Type-only: the values come from `gi://` at runtime, which resolves only inside a
// GTK process. `@girs/*` is the same vocabulary as data, so `tsc` can read it here.
