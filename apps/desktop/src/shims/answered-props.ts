// The props this host answers for the layer, as DATA rather than as a comment.
//
// `shims/react-native.tsx`'s header carries this as a prose table, and that table has
// now been wrong twice in the same way: it describes a refusal that upstream has since
// answered, the shim goes on handling the prop harmlessly, and the app is told it lost
// a capability it has. `flex-wrap` was the first (stripped here until
// `@gjsify/react-native` 0.46 mapped it to a wrapping widget, with a note to remove the
// branch that had been acted on while the README kept the consequence). This file is so
// that the second time is a failing test rather than a re-read.
//
// `@gjsify/react-native/prop-table` is what makes it checkable: `explainProp(primitive,
// prop)` returns `null` when the layer renders a prop and the sentence a render would
// print when it does not. So every entry here is a claim that can be verified against
// the installed layer, and `test/prop-gate.test.ts` verifies it in both directions.
//
// WHAT THIS FILE IS NOT. It is not the set of props the app passes — that is a question
// about JSX in 26 screens, and about components like `<Typo>` that forward `...rest`
// onto a primitive, which is what let `<Typo onPress>` through and took Home down. That
// check needs a parser and one level of forwarding analysis; `test/support-gate.test.ts`
// names it as the remaining half. This file answers the narrower question that needs no
// parser at all: **is each workaround still necessary?**

/**
 * Props this file used to answer and the layer has since answered ITSELF.
 *
 * A DECLARED EXCEPTION LEDGER, not a to-do list that reads as one. Each of these is
 * measured `ACCEPTED` by the installed layer, which means the shim's handling of it is
 * now redundant — harmless, because handling a prop the layer would also handle changes
 * nothing observable, and worth removing on the next touch of the relevant branch
 * because a redundant workaround is indistinguishable from a necessary one.
 *
 * The reason it is a LIST and not a set of deletions is that removing each one is a
 * behaviour change to verify on three platforms, and the sessions that added them
 * measured rather than rewrote. The test holds the list exact in both directions: a
 * further prop the layer catches up on fails here, and so does an entry the layer goes
 * back to refusing.
 *
 * Two of these are capability GAINS rather than bookkeeping, and both are still to be
 * wired:
 *
 *   * `accessibilityLiveRegion` on `Text`. This host's header says a screen-reader user
 *     is told nothing on the door, and the layer answers it through
 *     `Gtk.Accessible.announce()` on the one element whose content IS its message.
 *
 *     TWO THINGS HAVE TO MOVE FOR THAT, and the entry is easy to misread as one. The
 *     layer accepts it on `Text` and still REFUSES it on `View`
 *     (`explainProp('View', 'accessibilityLiveRegion')` is not null), and the app's two
 *     call sites are both `<View accessibilityLiveRegion="polite">`
 *     (`gate/LoginGate.tsx`). So the shim's drop is load-bearing for the app as it
 *     stands, and the gain needs the prop moved onto the `Typo` whose text is the
 *     message — a change in `apps/mobile`, not here.
 *
 *     THE HAZARD IS THAT THE DROP IS UNCONDITIONAL while the layer's answer is
 *     per-primitive: the day somebody moves the prop to the `Typo`, this shim will
 *     swallow a prop the layer would have honoured, silently. Making the drop
 *     conditional on the primitive is the fix, and it needs the primitive threaded into
 *     `normalize`, which is why it is written down here rather than done in passing.
 *   * **`accessibilityRole` on `View`, 41 call sites**, which this shim DROPS. It was
 *     dropped because the layer had no answer, not because GTK has none — the header of
 *     `react-native.tsx` measured that and said the entry would move the day the layer
 *     grew the role family. gjsify 0.48 grew it
 *     ([#1541](https://github.com/gjsify/gjsify/pull/1541)), so those 41 sites are a
 *     deletion away from having a role, and `accessible` and the two implemented ones
 *     come with them.
