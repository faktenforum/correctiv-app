// `react-native`, as this host answers it.
//
// The build aliases the bare `react-native` specifier here rather than straight to
// `@gjsify/react-native`, and this file is the entire reason why: the app passes six
// prop families that the GTK layer refuses BY NAME, in 110 places, and every one of
// those refusals is correct. This is where each of them gets a deliberate answer,
// once, instead of 110 times.
//
// Everything else is re-exported untouched, including the refusing exports — so a
// name the GTK layer does not implement is a loud throw naming its tier rather than an
// undefined import. `Animated` used to be the example here; 0.46 implements the subset
// this app uses, and it now arrives through this file as the real thing.
//
// ## The six, what each one is, and what happens to it here
//
// **The table below is prose; `answered-props.ts` is the same thing as DATA, and it is
// the one a test can check.** Keep them in step — and note that the check has already
// paid for itself twice: ten of the rows here describe a refusal the layer has since
// answered itself, so their entries live in that file's `UPSTREAM_CAUGHT_UP` ledger
// rather than among the necessary ones. The four newest arrived with gjsify 0.48, which
// answers the accessibility props on every primitive this app uses — the test went red
// on the upgrade and named all four, which is the whole reason it exists.
// `test/prop-gate.test.ts` holds the split exact in both directions, because a
// redundant workaround reads exactly like a necessary one.
//
// | prop | uses | GTK's refusal | this host |
// |---|---|---|---|
// | `accessibilityLabel` | 45 | — | the layer's, since 0.48 |
// | `accessibilityState` | 5 | — | the layer's, since 0.48 |
// | `accessibilityRole` | 40 | — | the layer's, since 0.48 |
// | `accessible` | 0 | — | the layer's, since 0.48 |
// | `hitSlop` | 13 | GTK hit-tests the allocation and cannot grow it | DROPPED, and correctly |
// | `pointerEvents="box-none"` | 4 | `can-target` is one boolean for a widget AND its subtree | mapped to `auto` |
// | `trackColor`/`thumbColor` | 2 | Adwaita paints a switch from the theme accent | DROPPED |
// | `placeholderTextColor` | 4 | the placeholder is a CSS SUBNODE, not a widget property | DROPPED — Adwaita already dims it |
// | `contentContainerClassName` | 10 | `<ScrollView>` has a content box; `<FlatList>` has none | merged into the list's own `className` |
// | `autoFocus` | 2 | `grab_focus()` only works once the widget is MAPPED | IMPLEMENTED, from the ref on `map` |
// | `autoComplete`/`textContentType` | 4 | autofill hints; a GTK app has no autofill service to hint AT | DROPPED — `keyboardType` and `secureTextEntry` already carry the purpose |
// | `submitBehavior` | 1 | it asks a soft keyboard to stay up, and there is none | DROPPED — Enter fires `onSubmitEditing` here either way |
// | `accessibilityLiveRegion` | 2 | GTK4 has no live-region property; its counterpart is imperative | DROPPED — see below |
//
// One entry is not a prop at all: `TextInput` is a CLASS in React Native, so it names
// a type as well as a value, and its ref carries `focus()`. The layer declares it as a
// function and hands over the bare widget, so `useRef<TextInput>(null)` does not
// compile and `ref.current.focus()` is `undefined is not a function`. Both are
// answered at the export near the bottom of this file, which says why only `focus` is.
//
// `hitSlop` is the one worth being explicit about, because dropping a prop is
// normally the failure mode this whole layer exists to prevent. It is an 8 px
// expansion of a TOUCH target — a concession to a fingertip, on a platform whose
// pointer is a mouse with single-pixel precision. There is nothing to preserve. The
// refusal exists to make someone decide rather than to forbid; this is the decision,
// made once and written down.
//
// `accessibilityRole` was called the honest loss here, on the grounds that GTK's
// `accessible-role` is set at construction and a ref fires too late. **That is wrong,
// and it was measured wrong rather than argued away.** In `Gtk-4.0.gir` the property is
// `writable="1"` with no `construct-only`; the `construct="1"` on `Gtk.Widget`'s copy
// means it MAY be set at construction, not only then. `construct-only="1"` appears 69
// times in that file and not on this property, and a post-construction write was
// measured to stick on twelve widget classes — including under `GTK_A11Y=none`.
//
// So the 41 call sites are not lost to GTK. They are unimplemented, which is a
// different sentence, and the difference matters: a capability believed absent gets
// designed around, and this one was.
//
// It was not implemented HERE, deliberately: `@gjsify/react-native` was growing the
// whole accessibility surface as a route family — 40 role names, 33 mapped, 7 refused by
// name with advice — and a 41-site reimplementation in this shim would have been
// redundant the day that landed. **It landed**, in 0.48
// ([gjsify #1541](https://github.com/gjsify/gjsify/pull/1541)), and the wait was the
// right call: the layer answers `accessibilityLabel`, `accessibilityRole`,
// `accessibilityState`, `accessibilityHint` and `accessible` on every primitive this
// app uses, so this file now passes all five through and applies none of them.
//
// It is a DELETION that adds a capability, which is the shape worth noticing. The two
// this file implemented were reimplementations; the two it dropped were losses. 40
// `accessibilityRole` call sites — 20 `link`, 17 `button`, one `radio`, one
// `adjustable` — reach `Gtk.Accessible:accessible-role` for the first time, and the
// layer maps all four names. `accessibilityState.disabled` goes through too, which this
// file used to withhold on the grounds that `disabled` already sets `sensitive` and two
// sources for one fact is a bug: the layer measured that pair on GTK 4.22.4 and they do
// not collide — an explicit write leaves `sensitive` alone, and React Native treats the
// two as separate props an application sets together.
//
// What is left of this file's accessibility handling is `applyAutoFocus`, which is a
// different thing entirely: a moment rather than an attribute.
//
// What still holds from the old paragraph: a `Pressable` is announced as a button
// because it IS a real `Gtk.Button`, and the label lands, which is the part a
// screen-reader user needs most.
//
// `accessibilityLiveRegion` is the second loss, and the one to come back to. GTK4 has
// no property for it: the counterpart is `Gtk.Accessible.announce()` (4.14+), an
// imperative call that needs the MOMENT and the TEXT, and a declarative prop on a
// container carries neither. Both uses are on the door — the sign-in failure and the
// "we are checking" line — so a screen-reader user there is told nothing until the
// announcement is wired from the state change that causes it, which is app code
// rather than this file. Named here so it is a decision with a cost rather than a
// prop that quietly went missing.
//
// It is coming back sooner than from here: `@gjsify/react-native` is growing an answer
// on `Text`, through that same `Gtk.Accessible.announce()`. That is the right place for
// it — the layer holds the widget and sees the text change, and this file sees neither.
// When it lands, the row above becomes IMPLEMENTED and this paragraph goes with it.
// Check the door when it does, because both uses are there.

 * Flatten `<>…</>` out of a child list.
 *
 * THIS IS A WORKAROUND FOR A REAL gjsify DEFECT, and it is worth stating precisely

 *
 * A `View` becomes a `Gtk.Overlay` only if it can SEE that one of its children is
 * absolutely positioned. `childFacts` in @gjsify/react-native asks each child element
 * for its own props (`isAbsoluteChild` -> `declaresAbsolute(child.props)`), and a
 * `React.Fragment` answers for itself: it has no `className`, so it is not absolute,
 * and the fragment's CONTENTS are never examined.
 *
 * So a parent handed `<>{a}{absolute}</>` stays a `Gtk.Box`, and the failure surfaces
 * one level down, on the child, as
 *
 *   <View> absolute — positions this element on top of its parent, so the PARENT has
 *   to be a `Gtk.Overlay` — and it is not ... the parent here is either not a `View`
 *   (a `ScrollView`, a `Pressable`, a `Text`) or the element is a root
 *
 * — a message that lists three causes, none of which is the actual one. Measured on
 * `components/media/MediaCard.tsx`, which passes `overlay={<>…</>}` to
 * `components/ui/Thumbnail.tsx`; that is every video thumbnail on Home and in the
 * Mediathek, so it is the whole screen rather than an edge case.
 *
 * Flattening here restores the parent's view of its own children. It is a consumer-side
 * shim for a layer defect, so:
 *
 * fixed upstream in gjsify: childFacts should flatten Fragments before counting
 * absolute children — remove this function and its two call sites on the next bump.
