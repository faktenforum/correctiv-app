// The INSET has no desktop meaning and the LAYOUT does, which is the split
// `@gjsify/react-native` already makes for React Native's own `SafeAreaView`. A GTK
// window is not behind a notch, a home indicator or a rounded corner; it is a
// rectangle the compositor gives the application whole.
//
// So the insets are zero — a real answer, not a placeholder — and `SafeAreaView` is
// a `View` in every other respect, which is what its call sites need it to be.
// `components/ui/Screen.tsx` wraps every screen in one with `edges={['top']}` and a
// `className`, so it has to lay out and paint like the `View` it wraps.
