/**
 * The door, in this host's own root layout.
 *
 * ADR 0016 makes admission a RENDER BRANCH rather than a redirect: while the session
 * is not admitted the root layout renders `LoginGate` INSTEAD of the navigator, so no
 * route is mounted and there is nothing to deep-link to, share or press back into. A
 * host that keeps the navigator mounted and redirects instead has not implemented that
 * decision, it has implemented a suggestion.
 *
 * This host is where that goes wrong quietly. It re-exports the phone's screens, so a
 * screen arrives here by existing; the root layout does not, and it went ten commits
 * with the navigator mounted unconditionally while every screen and every test was
 * green. The failure has no symptom on the machine of whoever is already admitted,
 * which is every machine this host currently runs on.
 *
 * WHAT THIS READS, AND WHY IT IS THE SOURCE. There is no GTK in `npm run check` and no
 * React renderer in this workspace: `_layout.tsx` reaches `gi://Gtk` through three
 * different imports before it reaches a component, so rendering it here would mean
 * faking the host and then testing the fake. The other three suites in this directory
 * made the same call for the same reason. So the assertions below are about the file's
 * TEXT, and they are written against the phone's file as well as this one — an oracle
 * that can rot silently is the failure this whole directory exists to avoid, so the
 * last test checks that the phone still has a door in the shape being compared to.
 *
 * WHAT IT DOES NOT PROVE: that the gate RENDERS on GTK. That is `npm run route-sweep`
 * and a capture; the gate's imports are covered by `test/support-gate.test.ts`, which
 * reads the phone's whole source tree against the published support table.
