/**
 * The desktop route tree may not drift from the phone's.

 * will not create. Without this test the failure mode is the quiet one: a route exists
 * on the phone, is simply absent here, and the desktop build stays green while a screen
 * is missing.
 *
 * That is the same shape as `apps/mobile/__tests__/web-target.test.ts`, which exists
 * because a broken route and a working export look identical from the outside.
