/**
 * The brand faces: one table, three readers, and they must agree.
 *
 * `src/style/fonts.ts` says which loaded-family name is which family and weight.
 * `scripts/stage-fonts.mjs` copies exactly those files into `data/fonts/`. The shim
 * resolves `fontFamily` through the same table. And the NAMES come from a fourth
 * place that knows nothing about any of it: `FAMILY_MAP` in
 * `apps/mobile/src/lib/theme/fonts.ts`, which the phone and the web target share.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS ASSERTED IN BOTH DIRECTIONS. Neither direction of drift reports itself:
 *
 *   - a name the app can produce and the table does not carry is a **substituted
 *     typeface**. Pango does not report a missing family — `set_family()` against a
 *     map that never got the file resolves to the default sans, the window draws, the
 *     process exits 0, and the app is simply wearing the wrong face;
 *   - a table entry no name reaches is a face that ships, and is paid for in bytes and
 *     in a licence obligation, for nothing.
 *
 * The phone's file is read as TEXT rather than imported, deliberately. It imports
 * `@expo-google-fonts/*` for the asset ids, which this host shims away and a test has
 * no shim for — and a second independent reading is the mechanism here anyway. It is
 * the same trade `tokens.test.ts` makes.
