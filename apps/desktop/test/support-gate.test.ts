/**
 * The build-time support gate, reproduced in this repository.
 *
 * `gjsify build --dialect react-native` composes a gate that fails a build on an
 * import whose ADR 0032 support-table status is not supported/partial. This host does
 * not use that flag — `gjsify.config.mjs` explains why: the flag's alias plugin is
 * `pre`, so it would win over the redirect to `src/shims/react-native.tsx`, and that
 * shim is what answers the 110 refused props the app passes.
 *
 * Giving up the gate would be the wrong half of that trade, so it is reproduced here,
 * against the SAME published table the gate reads
 * (`@gjsify/react-native/support-table`). Two things this version does that the
 * original cannot:
 *
 *   - it runs in `npm run check`, in about a second, with no GTK and no build;
 *   - it reads the app's source, so it fails when a SCREEN grows an unsupported
 *     import, which is where the change will actually come from.
 *
 * What it does NOT cover: props. A refused prop is a render-time refusal per screen,
 * and `npm run route-sweep` is what opens every route and reads the log for one.
 *
 * ## The prop hole, and what closes it
 *
 * That gap is not theoretical, and it is the most expensive thing about this host.
 * `(tabs)/profil.tsx` grew three `<Typo onPress>` rows; the layer refuses `onPress` on
 * a `Gtk.Label`, correctly, and because the tab stack mounts all five tabs from `/` the
 * uncaught `PrimitiveError` ended the whole tree — Home captured 12 848 bytes where it
 * had captured 92 125. This test was green through all of it, so was the typecheck, and
 * so was the build. The only thing that said anything was a screenshot.
 *
 * The named next step was `@gjsify/react-native/prop-table`, and **it publishes now**
 * (verified in 0.47.0: `./prop-table` is among the package's export subpaths). It
 * exposes the layer's per-prop answers as DATA the way `support-table` already exposes
 * the per-import ones, and `explainProp(primitive, prop)` returns exactly the assertion
 * a consumer makes — `null` when the prop renders, the sentence a render would print
 * when it does not.
 *
 * So the hole is closable here, in a second, with no GTK. What it still needs is the
 * other half of the question: this app's shim ANSWERS 110 of the props the layer
 * refuses, so a test asserting `explainProp(...) === null` on the app's source would
 * fail on every one of them. The set the shim answers has to become data first — it is
 * a prose table in `src/shims/react-native.tsx`'s header today — and then this file can
 * assert the difference. Until then `npm run route-sweep` is the only oracle, and it
 * needs a GTK session, a built bundle and an admitted profile.
 * ([ADR 0026](../../../adr/0026-re-exported-screens-and-a-variant-where-the-host-refuses.md))

/**
 * Names the app imports from `react-native` that this host answers WITHOUT the
 * support table's blessing, each with the file that does it.
 *
 * EMPTY, and it took two rounds to get back here. An entry should be argued for, not
 * added: the alternative to a variant is usually a shim, and a shim that fakes a
 * subsystem is worse than a screen that does without it.
 *
 * `Animated` was the one entry and is the whole history of this list. It was a refusing
 * export until @gjsify/react-native 0.46, which implements the three names this app
 * uses; the assertion at the bottom of this file went red on that upgrade and named the
 * variant, which was duly deleted — and came straight back, because an `Animated.View`
 * child did not make its parent a `Gtk.Overlay` the way a `View` child does, so the
 * phone's `absolute` overlay header threw. The entry stayed with an `importableAnyway`
 * sentence saying so. 0.48 fixed the composition (gjsify #1451, closed by #1537: a
 * wrapper is transparent to the facts a parent reads), the phone's header renders here,
 * and the entry is gone.
 *
 * **THE ASSERTION BELOW DID NOT CATCH THAT, and cannot.** It accepts an
 * `importableAnyway` sentence as the re-argument, so a sentence that had become false
 * passed. There is no oracle for it either: the published prop table answers "is this
 * prop accepted on this primitive" and nothing published answers "does this element
 * make its parent an overlay". The entry was re-checked because the whole 0.47 → 0.48
 * ledger was, and ADR 0026's second addendum says so rather than leaving it implied.
