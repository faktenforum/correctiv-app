/**
 * The component gallery: every component in `src/components`, in one scroll.
 *
 * A page for developers and designers, published like any other route: see
 * `src/app/gallery.tsx` for what that costs and for how to reach it while the
 * dev server is running.
 *
 * ## Why the chrome uses the app's own components
 *
 * The labels are `Typo` and `Overline` rather than a bare `Text`, which means a
 * fault in `Typo` disfigures the gallery's own furniture as well as its specimens.
 * That is the lesser risk: no screen in this app sets a text colour through a
 * class, so `text-on-canvas` is an untravelled path, and a gallery whose labels
 * were the first thing to use it would be reporting on itself. The specimens are
 * separated from the chrome by being boxed and outlined instead.
 *
 * ## Why each specimen is drawn twice
 *
 * Once on `canvas` and once on `surface`. A component that reaches for a primitive
 * where it meant a semantic token — `bg-white` for `bg-canvas` — looks right on
 * exactly one of the two, and looks right on both in light mode. Two surfaces and
 * the appearance control below are between them the cheapest way to see it.
