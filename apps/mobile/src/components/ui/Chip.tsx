/**
 * Selection chip (onboarding interests, discover topics). Active = red fill.
 *
 * **The label does not shrink**, which is React Native's own default written out
 * and therefore no change on the phone. It is load-bearing on the GTK4 host that
 * [ADR 0012](../../../../../adr/0012-a-list-virtualizer-for-the-unbounded-lists.md)
 * names as a reason: a `Gtk.Box` squeezes its children between their minimum and
 * their natural size, so in a narrow window the last chip of a rail was squeezed
 * far enough for its label to wrap onto three lines, which the rail then clipped.
 * Declared, the rail overflows and scrolls instead, which is what a chip rail does
 * on the phone. The widths are in that host's README on the `desktop` branch,
 * which is the only place they are written down.
 *
 * **No `numberOfLines`, and that is the decision rather than an omission.** It was
 * measured as the alternative and is worse: it takes a label's minimum width down
 * to a single character, so every chip in the rail truncates instead of one being
 * squeezed. `__tests__/one-line-labels.test.tsx` asserts the absence, so reaching
 * for it means reading this first.
