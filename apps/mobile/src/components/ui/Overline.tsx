/**
 * A small letter-spaced heading with no fill — the group label in the directory,
 * the kicker above a card. Matches `text-[12px] font-bold tracking-[1.2px]` in the
 * design draft, which uses this mark for section headings throughout.
 *
 * Not the same as `Badge`: that is the same typography ON a fill. The component
 * uppercases the label itself, because the capitals are part of the design and the
 * data arrives in title case ("Junge Formate").
 *
 * **One line, and it does not shrink.** Both are declared rather than left to a
 * default, and both are answers to the same property of a layout engine that
 * derives a label's minimum width from its own text: a letter-spaced mark with a
 * space in it is allocated its natural width, breaks there, and loses the second
 * line to the height its parent already committed. Padding cannot fix it, because
 * padding raises the natural width and the text's budget by the same pixel; a
 * single-word mark ("RECHERCHE") has no break opportunity and was never affected.
 *
 * The engine is GTK4/Adwaita, through `@gjsify/react-native`, on the host
 * [ADR 0012](../../../../../adr/0012-a-list-virtualizer-for-the-unbounded-lists.md)
 * names as a reason for `FlatList`. **The pixels are recorded there and only
 * there**, in that host's README on the `desktop` branch, for the reason
 * `app/gallery.tsx` gives about its own figure: a measurement typed twice is a
 * measurement that goes wrong in one of them, and nothing in `npm run check`
 * could catch the copy going stale.
 *
 * WHAT THIS COSTS ON THE PHONE, because it is not nothing. **One call site is
 * unbounded**: `article.kicker` in `gespeichert.tsx`, which is WordPress's
 * `post::topline` and is written by an editor, so a topline long enough to have
 * wrapped now ellipsizes instead. Every other label reaching this component comes
 * from this repository and is short enough for one line at a phone's width. That
 * ellipsis is the intended answer rather than a side effect: this mark is
 * uppercase and letter-spaced, and a wrapped one reads as a fault on any host.
 * The `a kicker longer than the line` specimen in `gallery/catalogue.tsx` is what
 * it looks like.
 *
 * **`flexShrink` is in `style`, and layout belongs in a class in this app** — a
 * deviation, so here is the reason. `__tests__/one-line-labels.test.tsx` asserts
 * this declaration by flattening the style, which is what a platform receives.
 * Uniwind's classes do not flatten in jest, so through `className="shrink-0"` the
 * only available assertion is that the string appears in a `className` — a weaker
 * oracle for a prop whose whole risk is being tidied away as noise.
