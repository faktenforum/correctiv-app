/**
 * A small label (project / fact check / backstage). Radius s, no shadows.
 *
 * **One line, and it does not shrink.** A pill is one line in the design, and the
 * two declarations are the same pair `Overline` carries for the same reason: this
 * is the same letter-spaced typography, on a fill instead of on the page, so a
 * layout engine that derives a label's minimum width from its text clips the
 * second line here too. `Overline`'s docblock has the argument, the pointer to
 * where the pixels are recorded, and why `flexShrink` is in `style`.
 *
 * `flexShrink: 0` is React Native's own default written out, so on a phone it is
 * nothing. In a browser it is not, because `react-native-web` gives that default
 * to `View` and not to `Text` — so this was read off the running web target
 * rather than reasoned about. At 320px, the narrower of the two widths, over
 * every specimen of the eight components where one of these labels sits beside
 * flexible content — `ui/Badge`, `ui/Overline`, `ui/Chip`, `profile/NavCard`,
 * `profile/ClubCard` (the one place an `Overline` is itself a row's flex item),
 * `media/EpisodeRow`, `media/LiveBanner`, `home/EarlyAccessCard` — every
 * rectangle holds still except the three that go from two lines to one, and all
 * three belong to the two components that say so themselves: `ui/Overline`'s long
 * kicker, and `media/LiveBanner`'s unbreakable track title plus, at this width
 * only, its ordinary subtitle. At 393px it is two.
 *
 * What does change is declarations. Eleven computed properties on a label that
 * gained `numberOfLines`, because rn-web swaps its whole one-line rule in
 * (`flex-shrink`, `max-width`, the four `overflow` longhands, `overflow-wrap`,
 * `text-overflow`, `text-wrap-mode`, `white-space-collapse`), and exactly one on
 * a `Chip` label, which gained only `flexShrink`.
 *
 * Why the rectangles hold: rn-web's `View` default already refuses to shrink, so
 * a pill overflows its row rather than being squeezed, and its label was never
 * under shrink pressure to begin with. `Backstage · Früher lesen` from
 * `home/EarlyAccessCard` is the label this was worth checking on, at 24
 * characters, and it still sets on one line at 393px.
