/**
 * `/gallery` — every component in `src/components`, on one page.
 *
 * A page for developers and designers rather than for readers, and it is
 * published like any other route. That was measured rather than assumed: the
 * components it draws are already in the bundle, because real screens use them,
 * so the page costs its catalogue and its fixtures and nothing else. ADR 0025
 * carries the figure, and is the only place it is written down, because a
 * measurement typed twice is a measurement that goes wrong in one of them.
 *
 * **The address alone does not reach this page on the dev server.** A development
 * bundle does not apply `experiments.baseUrl` when it matches routes, so
 * `/app/gallery` renders the app's own 404 — as does `/app/` itself
 * ([ADR 0025](../../../../adr/0025-the-published-app-is-a-production-bundle.md)).
 * A frame gets here anyway, by handing the route to the app's own router over the
 * dev handle; the handbook's `workbench/AppFrame.tsx` is what does it. Outside a
 * frame, `npm run web:root` starts the dev server without the base path so that
 * route matching works, and `/gallery` is then an ordinary address.

/**
 * `?c=ui/SectionCard` narrows the page to one component, `&bare=1` strips the
 * page's own furniture off it.
 *
 * `c` is what lets the handbook's reference link here, and what the way back is
 * addressed with. `componentId` in `gallery/catalogue.tsx` is the shape of it, and
 * the reference resolves the same two parts to its own rows.
 *
 * `bare` is for the frame that reference draws in each of its rows: 393 pixels
 * wide, one component in it, and the surrounding page already saying everything
 * this page's header says. It is a display, so it takes no chrome.
