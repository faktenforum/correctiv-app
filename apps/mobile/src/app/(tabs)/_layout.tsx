/**
 * The tab bar on iOS and Android is the system's, not ours.
 *
 * It is the one control in the app a user has already learned somewhere else, so it
 * should behave the way every other app on their phone behaves — the press feedback,
 * the scroll-to-top on a second tap, the iOS 26 minimise-on-scroll, the way it grows
 * with the system font size. All of that is free here and was absent from a drawn
 * bar, which only ever imitated it. The web has no system bar to borrow and keeps
 * the drawn one; see `_layout.web.tsx` for why that is a decision and not a
 * shortfall.
 *
 * Icons are each platform's own vocabulary rather than one set stretched across
 * both: SF Symbols on iOS, Material Symbols on Android, with a filled variant for
 * the selected state on each. Ionicons is still what the rest of the app draws with
 * — it is only the tab bar that defers, because the tab bar is the part users read
 * as belonging to the phone rather than to us.
 *
 * The colours still come from the token palette (`useColors`), so the bar follows
 * the appearance setting like everything else. Only its SHAPE is the platform's.
 *
 * See ADR 0013 for what this costs, which is not nothing: the API is alpha, all five
 * tabs now mount eagerly, and the bar's height can no longer be measured.

/**
 * Where the mini player sits on Android. Measured, not guessed — and it was guessed
 * once, which is the reason for the length of this comment.
 *
 * It used to be a value we SET: the drawn bar took `height: 56 + insets.bottom` from
 * this constant, so the bar and the mini player could not disagree. A native bar
 * sizes itself and expo-router's native tabs expose no height (`useBottomTabBarHeight`
 * belongs to the JS tabs; the documentation says layout information is unavailable),
 * so the number had to come from somewhere else. Carrying the 56 over looked free and
 * was not: Material 3's navigation bar is **80dp**, 56 was the Material 2 figure, and
 * the mini player sat 11px INSIDE the tab bar, clipping the selected item's pill.
 *
 * Measured on `Medium_Phone_API_36`, 1080x2400 at 420dpi: the bar occupies
 * y=2126..2337, which is 211px, which is 80.4dp — Material 3's documented height, and
 * it agrees with the spec rather than merely with one device. The 24dp of gesture
 * inset below it is what `insets.bottom` adds at the call site.
 *
 * Two things still move it, and neither is measurable from here: a large system font
 * scale, and `labelVisibilityMode` — under Material's `auto` the same bar measured
 * 60dp, because dropping the labels makes it shorter. Change either and re-measure.
 * **A screenshot of a playing track is the only check that sees this.**

        iOS has a slot for exactly this: the bar above the tab bar that Apple Music

        the two platforms genuinely differ here, and the overlay below is the Android

        is what Android media apps do.
