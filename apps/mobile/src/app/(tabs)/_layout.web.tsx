/**
 * The web tab bar, and the reason there are two of these files.
 *
 * `_layout.tsx` is native tabs, which is the whole point: on a phone the tab bar is
 * the one control a user already knows, and it should be the system's rather than a
 * drawing of one. The web has no system tab bar to borrow — expo-router's web
 * implementation of native tabs is 74 lines that render labels and NO icons — so
 * borrowing nothing is the wrong trade here. The web keeps the drawn tab bar, which
 * is the design draft's, and which is the better answer for this platform rather
 * than a consolation prize for it.
 *
 * That makes web a target with its own layout rather than a phone build that fell
 * short, which is what it has to be: it is published on every push to `main` and is
 * how most people will ever see this app.
 *
 * These two files share the routes and the MiniPlayer, and nothing else. Keep the
 * tab ORDER identical — it is the same information architecture, only drawn twice.
