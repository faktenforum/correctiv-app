 * they are checked first and by scheme rather than by URL shape.
 *
 * What is left splits on `isInternalArticleUrl`, whose own rules and their history
 * are worth reading before changing anything here.
 *
 * The final `allow` is for a scheme that is neither: `mailto:`, `tel:`, or an app
 * link. Handing those to the webview is what the reader has always done, and it is
 * the conservative branch — the app does not decide what it does not recognise.
 * There used to be a fourth case, `correctiv://join`, for a button in the reader's
 * second footer; ADR 0018 removed the footer and a test in the core now asserts
 * that scheme never reaches a document again.
