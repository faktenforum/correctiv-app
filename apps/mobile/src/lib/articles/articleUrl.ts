 * The rule used to require a date in the path (`/faktencheck/2026/08/04/…`), which

 * `correctiv.org/spotlight-newsletter/<slug>/` with no date, and those are exactly
 * the articles this app links to most, from the briefing on Home. Every one of them
 * left the app.
 *
 * So the test is inverted: internal unless the path is a listing, a file, or too
 * short to be an article. A bare section (`/lokal/`) is a landing page and belongs
 * in the browser. Should this still guess wrong, the reader's error state offers
 * "im Browser öffnen" — a misjudgement costs one tap, not the article.

/**
 * Whether a correctiv.org article is a fact check, read off its permalink.

 * The reason this is a URL rule and not a look at `FeedItem.feed`: the site-wide
 * `recherchen` stream stamps every card with the feed that was asked for, on
 * purpose, so that Home's "Neueste Recherchen" does not sprout Faktencheck badges
 * (`services/wp.service.ts` → `fetchWpFeed`). Every item in that stream therefore
 * says `feed: 'recherchen'`, fact checks included, and the field cannot answer this
 * question. `categories` cannot either: it carries display names rather than the
 * slugs `FEED_PRIORITY` matches on, and upstream files some posts under a
 * misspelled "Fakencheck" beside the correct one.
 *
 * The first path segment is the test, not a substring: fact checks live at
 * `/faktencheck/…`, including the sub-sectioned ones (`/faktencheck/hintergrund/…`,
 * `/faktencheck/aus-der-community/…`), and nothing else does.
