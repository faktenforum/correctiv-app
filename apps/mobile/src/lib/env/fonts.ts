/**
 * The app's five cuts, loaded.
 *
 * A module of its own so that `AppEnvironment.tsx` and `app/_layout.tsx` ask for
 * the fonts through one call and `lib/theme/font-assets.ts` keeps exactly one
 * importer. The list of files stays there; this is only the loading.
 *
 * Both hosts call it, and the second one is why it exists. The handbook applies
 * the family NAMES — `Typo` writes `fontFamily: 'SourceSans3_400Regular'` into a
 * TextStyle — and for a while loaded no file behind them, so a browser fell back
 * to its standard face, which is a serif. Every drawn component read as Times,
 * `variant="text-article"` was the wrong serif rather than Merriweather, and
 * every bold string lost its weight, because this app names one loaded family per
 * cut (`lib/theme/fonts.ts` says why) and a family that is not there takes the
 * weight with it.
 *
 * `expo-font` caches by family name, so the two call sites are one load.
