/**
 * Everything a component of this app needs around it before it draws correctly.
 *
 * **One definition, two hosts**, which is what [ADR 0006](../../../../../adr/0006-one-core-two-hosts.md)
 * asks for everywhere else. `app/_layout.tsx` wraps the router in this; the
 * handbook wraps every specimen it draws in the same component
 * (`apps/handbook/src/components/DirectPreview.tsx`). Neither keeps a list of
 * providers of its own, and `apps/handbook/test/environment.test.ts` fails if the
 * second one starts one.
 *
 * It exists because the handbook's copy of that list drifted, and the drift was
 * invisible on every check. Measured on 2026-09-11 against the assembled site,
 * with the handbook holding a `Provider` and a `SafeAreaProvider` and nothing
 * else: no font file was loaded at all, so all 45 components drew in the
 * browser's default serif rather than Source Sans, and every bold and semibold
 * string drew at regular weight — this app names one loaded family per cut, so a
 * missing family takes the weight with it. ADR 0028 carries the table.
 *
 * **What is deliberately NOT here**, because it is routing or the app's own
 * lifecycle and a drawn card has neither: the splash screen, the persistence
 * hydration, the onboarding redirect, the error boundary, the status bar, the
 * door (`LoginGate`) and the `Stack`. Those stay in `app/_layout.tsx`.
 *
 * **The ports are not here either.** `configurePlatform()` is what this host
 * gives the core — storage, the bundle, audio — and it is a statement about the
 * running app, not about how a component looks. The handbook leaves the core on
 * its default `createMemoryPlatform()` and a thunk that reaches for storage gets
 * an empty answer instead of throwing, which is what a drawn specimen wants.

   * defaulting, so something has to answer. In the app expo-router already does:
   * `ExpoRoot` mounts a `SafeAreaProvider` above the root route, which is why
   * `RecoveryScreen` can still draw after the boundary has unmounted everything
   * below it. On a page there is no router and no notch, so the handbook states
   * zero — and states it rather than letting a provider measure, because a
   * provider with nothing measured yet renders `null`, which inside a card is a
   * component that never appears.
   *
   * Left out, no provider is added. A second one nested inside expo-router's
   * would measure the same full-screen box and answer the same insets, so it
   * would be a wrapper that buys nothing and changes the app's tree.
