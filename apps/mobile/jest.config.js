/**
 * Packages jest must transform rather than take as-is, one alternative per line so
 * that adding one is a one-line diff with a reason next to it.
 *
 * Everything here ships ESM that Node's CommonJS require cannot read. Leaving a
 * package off does not degrade gracefully: the suite fails to RUN, with a
 * SyntaxError on the dependency's `export {` that names the importing file rather
 * than the package — so the message points at app code and the real culprit is a
 * dependency nobody touched.
 *
 * These are alternatives inside a negative lookahead, and the group is anchored on
 * `node_modules/` with NO leading slash. That matters: the parser block below is
 * installed under `packages/app-core/node_modules/`, not at the root, and a leading
 * slash would still match it — but see the hoisting entry in TROUBLESHOOTING.md for
 * why the location is not a contract and this pattern must not depend on it.

  // `unimodules`, `react-navigation`, `react-native-svg`) are not dependencies of
  // this app at all and are inert — they stay because this list is a copy of the
  // preset's, and pruning it would be a change in behaviour on the day one of them
  // arrives as a transitive dependency.
