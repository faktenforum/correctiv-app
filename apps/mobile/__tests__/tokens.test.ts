/**
 * The token bridge: makes sure the committed artefacts still match the source

 *
 * The bridge itself lives in @correctiv/design-tokens, so that the CMS can consume
 * the same values; the check stays here, because this app is the consumer that
 * would show the damage, and because this is the suite CI already runs. All five
 * artefacts belong to the package now — nothing is written into this app since
 * the move to Uniwind, because a Tailwind v4 theme is CSS and CSS is portable.
 *
 * Two kinds of check live here and they catch different things. Keep them apart:
 *
 *   drift        the committed files are what the generator produces right now.
 *                Catches an edited artefact and a forgotten `npm run tokens`;
 *                blind to a generator that is wrong, because then both sides are
 *                wrong together and agree.
 *   content      a specific line is in a specific artefact. Catches exactly the
