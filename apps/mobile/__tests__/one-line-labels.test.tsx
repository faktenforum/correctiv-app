/**
 * The four labels that may not wrap, and the two declarations that stop them.
 *
 * `Badge`, `Overline`, `Chip` and `LiveBanner`'s now-playing line each carry
 * `numberOfLines`, `flexShrink: 0`, or a deliberate absence of one of them, and
 * each of those is an answer to a measurement on the GTK4 host ADR 0012 names as
 * a reason. Every component's own docblock has the measurement.
 *
 * WHY A TEST AND NOT THE MEASUREMENT ITSELF. The measurement is a claim about
 * Pango and `Gtk.Box`, and there is no GTK in `npm run check` — the host that
 * produced it is not built here. So the oracle available on this side is the
 * weaker one: that the props still reach the text.
 *
 * That is exactly the failure worth catching, because three of the four look like
 * noise. `flexShrink: 0` is React Native's own default written out, so removing it
 * changes nothing a reviewer can see in a screenshot of either target; it changes
 * a chip rail on a third host into three clipped lines.
 *
 * WHAT IT DOES NOT PROVE: that the labels are readable on GTK. That is a route
 * sweep and a capture on the host, and it lives with the host.
