/**
 * The root layout's three decisions that nothing else can see.
 *
 *  1. **The Provider has to hold the core's singleton.** Screens read through the
 *     Provider (`useAppSelector`), while `coreActions` and the two modules that run
 *     outside React dispatch straight into the imported store. Those are only the
 *     same store because this file hands the Provider that very instance — an
 *     invariant with no other enforcement, and one whose breach is silent: both
 *     halves keep working and the screens simply stop updating.
 *  2. **The jump into the onboarding fires once, and only from `/`.** Anywhere else
 *     it would overwrite every shared link on the web target, which is the whole
 *     reason the pathname is checked; and it is a `replace`, because the onboarding
 *     is not a place one returns to.
 *  3. **The door comes first.** Nothing behind it is decided, the onboarding jump
 *     included, until the session is admitted, and admitted means an entitlement
 *     with the app in it, never a contribution. The session hydrates before the
 *     first render like everything else, so a returning member is not shown the
 *     form for a frame.
 *
 * Neither was testable while the gate was a module-level `let`: the first mount in
 * a suite consumed it for every mount after it, so any second assertion passed
 * because nothing happened rather than because the right thing did.
