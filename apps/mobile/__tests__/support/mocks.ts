/**
 * The doubles every suite wanted, identically, and therefore copied.
 *
 * Registered through `setupFiles` in jest.config.js, so it runs before each test
 * module is required and the mocks are in the registry by the time it imports
 * anything. Not a `.test.ts`, so testMatch ignores it.
 *
 * Only doubles that are **inert** belong here: nothing in this file is something a
 * test asserts against. That is the line. The expo-router mock is deliberately NOT
 * here even though eight suites carry a near-copy of it — its shape differs per
 * suite (`dismissTo` and `canGoBack` in one, `Stack` in another), and the suites
 * assert on `router.push`. A double you make claims about should be visible in the
 * file making them.
 *
 * A suite that needs different behaviour still declares its own `jest.mock`; a
 * file-local factory wins over this one.
