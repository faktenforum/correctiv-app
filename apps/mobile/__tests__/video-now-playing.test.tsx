/**
 * Does the system's own media UI learn anything about a video?
 *
 * The podcast player has told it since day one — `lib/audio/backend.ts` calls
 * `setActiveForLockScreen` with a title, an artist and artwork, so a track appears on
 * the lock screen and in Control Center. A video told it NOTHING, and for two reasons
 * that are invisible from inside the app:
 *
 *   - `showNowPlayingNotification` is documented `@default false`, so the entry was
 *     never created at all;
 *   - the source was a bare url string, and `metadata` is what populates that entry —
 *     "when undefined the player will display information contained in the video
 *     metadata", which for a PeerTube HLS playlist is nothing worth showing.
 *
 * Neither is checkable by looking at the screen: the difference is on the lock screen
 * of a real phone. So this intercepts `useVideoPlayer` and asserts on what the screen
 * actually hands the player.
 *
 * WHAT THIS DOES NOT PROVE, said rather than implied: that the entry appears. That is
 * the OS's half, it needs a device, and on Android it additionally needs the config
 * plugin's `supportsBackgroundPlayback` — which `app-config.test.ts` gates, because
 * that half only fails on one platform long after every check is green.
