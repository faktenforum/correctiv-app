/**
 * The root error boundary, and the hang it replaces.
 *
 * Until it existed, a throw before `fontsLoaded && storeReady` left the app on the
 * splash screen for ever: `preventAutoHideAsync()` runs at module scope and
 * `hideAsync()` only behind both flags, so a fault in between meant no crash, no
 * message, and a restart doing the same thing again.
 *
 * Two properties are worth more than the copy assertions here.
 *
 *  1. **The splash screen comes down.** Asserted on the app's own
 *     `expo-splash-screen` double, and asserted in the case where the shell CANNOT
 *     have hidden it: the fonts are unloaded, so the shell's own effect is behind a
 *     false condition and the only caller left is the boundary.
 *  2. **A font failure reaches the boundary at all.** `useFonts` does not throw. It
 *     returns the error and leaves `fontsLoaded` false for ever, which is a silent
 *     hang rather than a caught error, so the layout has to rethrow it. Separated
 *     below from "the fonts are merely still loading", which must keep rendering
 *     null behind the splash.
 *
 * The tree is mounted through the real `Try` — the component expo-router itself
 * wraps a route's default export in when the file also exports `ErrorBoundary` — so
 * `retry()` here means what it means in the app. And it is mounted WITHOUT a Redux
 * Provider around it, deliberately: `Try` catches by unmounting `RootLayout`, which
 * is where the app's Provider lives, so a boundary that read the store would throw
 * inside the boundary. Mounting it the way the router does is what would catch that.
