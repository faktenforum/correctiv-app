/**
 * The one rule the colour system cannot survive without: the app's setting and the
 * styles must never disagree about which scheme is active.
 *
 * This replaces a regression test for a defect that shipped, and the defect is
 * worth keeping in view because the fix inverted the rule. Under NativeWind,
 * `'system'` had to be resolved to a concrete scheme HERE before being passed on:
 * handing it through left the JavaScript following the device while
 * `darkMode: 'class'` waited for a class nothing added, so `useColors()` returned
 * the dark palette while `bg-grey-100` stayed white. Typecheck, lint, the tests,
 * the Android build and the web export were all green, and a browser walk missed it
 * too — it flipped the setting to `'dark'` and pinned the emulated
 * `prefers-color-scheme` to light, exercising both paths that work and neither that
 * breaks.
 *
 * Under Uniwind the correct move is the opposite one: `setTheme` takes `'system'`
 * and resolves it itself, so resolving it here would be the bug — it would pin the
 * app to whatever the device said at mount and stop it following a later change.
 * So what this now asserts is that the setting arrives VERBATIM.
