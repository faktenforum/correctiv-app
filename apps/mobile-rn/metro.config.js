 * …and this is the price of that line, paid once.
 *
 * A package that npm did NOT hoist, because a version conflict made it keep a
 * nested copy. `react-dom@19` requires `scheduler@^0.27` and react-native requires
 * a different one, so npm puts one inside `node_modules/react-dom/node_modules/`
 * — and with hierarchical lookup off, Metro cannot walk up from react-dom's own
 * source to reach it. The web export failed on `scheduler`, a package nobody in
 * this repo depends on directly.
 *
 * Retrying from the requesting file's directory is what Node would do, and it
 * finds exactly the copy npm chose for that package. It runs only after normal
 * resolution has already failed, so nothing that resolves today starts resolving
 * twice — the guarantee the line above buys is intact.
 *
 * ## A second workaround used to live here, and it is worth knowing why it went
 *
 * React Native declares `pretty-format@^29` and carries its own copy. `@types/jest@30`
 * declares a RUNTIME dependency on `pretty-format@^30` — a types package pulling a
 * runtime package — so npm hoisted v30 to the root while the app was on `jest@^29`.
 * Version 30 exports a different shape, so RN's HMR client read
 * `prettyFormat.default.default` off `undefined` and the DEV BUNDLE DIED AT STARTUP:
 * a blank page with one uncaught TypeError. It stayed unnoticed because every
 * browser check in this project ran against `expo export` output, which has no HMR
 * client.
 *
 * The workaround was a `resolveRequest` branch pointing `pretty-format` at React
 * Native's own directory. Aligning `@types/jest` to `^29` removes the conflict at
 * its source, so the branch is gone. Verified by running the dev bundle on an
 * emulator without it: the app renders and logcat reports no TypeError.
 *
 * If `pretty-format` ever breaks the dev bundle again, look at what pulls a second
 * major to the root before reaching for a resolver branch.
