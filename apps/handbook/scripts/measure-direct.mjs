/*
 * How many of the app's components a Vite build in this package can bundle.
 *
 *   cd apps/handbook && node scripts/measure-direct.mjs [--only <substring>]
 *
 * One `vite build` per component, each with a throwaway entry that imports that
 * one file and nothing else, so a failure names the component rather than the
 * run. It prints `built / failed` with the first line of each error, and that
 * output is the evidence behind the number in ADR 0027.
 *
 * A script and not a test, on purpose. The number moves when `react-native`,
 * `expo` or Rolldown move, and none of those are in this repository. A check
 * that reddens for something nobody here changed gets switched off, and then it
 * is not a check. What CI does keep is `test/direct.test.ts`, which asserts that
 * the components the handbook claims to draw exist — a fact this repository owns.
 *
 * Why per component and not one build of all 47: Rolldown stops at the first
 * parse error, so a single build answers "does everything work" and never "how
 * much of it does". The first measurement of this was also run with the wrong
 * Vite — the repository root's, hoisted for vitest — which is the other half of
 * why it is a committed script now and not a command somebody types.
