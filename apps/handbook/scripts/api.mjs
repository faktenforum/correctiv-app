/**
 * The reference, extracted with TypeDoc and reduced to what the site renders.
 *
 * TypeDoc runs as a DATA EXTRACTOR here, never as a site generator: `--json`
 * only, no HTML, no theme. The handbook renders the model with its own
 * components, which is the whole reason this approach was chosen. A generated
 * documentation site would have arrived with its own navigation and its own
 * design, and the generated pages would have become the front door by accident.
 *
 * The raw model is tens of megabytes and mostly type-resolution bookkeeping, so
 * it is reduced here rather than shipped. What survives is what a reference panel
 * shows: a name, what kind of thing it is, its signature, its prose and the line
 * it lives on.
 *
 * TWO HALVES, NAMED APART. `core` is a library: every module is a subpath a
 * caller imports from `@correctiv/app-core`, and a symbol is a symbol whatever
 * kind it is. `components` is the app's own vocabulary: a folder under
 * `apps/mobile/src/components`, a component, and the props it takes. They are
 * separate keys rather than one flat list because they answer different
 * questions, and a reader who cannot tell which is which will reach for
 * `@correctiv/app-core/ui/Button`, which does not exist.
 *
 * They also need two TypeDoc runs, because a run takes one tsconfig and these two
 * differ in the parts that decide whether the files parse at all: the app's
 * extends Expo's base for JSX, and it carries the `@/*` and `@correctiv/*` path
 * aliases every component's imports are written with.
 *
 * Neither package has a barrel to hand TypeDoc, so both are expanded over their
 * source directory. In `packages/app-core` that is on purpose (ADR: subpath
 * imports, the root entry exposes only the ports) and every module is a subpath;
 * under `src/components` a component file simply IS its import path, except in
 * `ui/`, where `index.ts` is the barrel every call site goes through.

 * declaration. In `articles/load.ts` that block explains the whole five-rung
 * cascade and sits above a private constant, so TypeDoc drops it on the floor
 * along with the constant. Losing it would leave the reference showing
 * signatures for the modules whose reasoning is the most worth reading.
 *
 * So the first block comment after the imports is read out of the source
 * directly, unless TypeDoc already attached that text to an exported symbol, in
 * which case it belongs to the symbol and not to the file.
 *
 * This is for the core only, and deliberately not for the components: their
 * convention is a doc comment sitting on the component itself, which TypeDoc
 * attaches correctly, and the one file where prose floats free
 * (`media/VideoFrame.tsx`) has three candidate blocks with no way to tell which
 * of them describes the component. A guess there would print "The origin the
 * embed claims to be on" as what `VideoFrame` is.
