 * and counts. A recipe that lived only in the site's config would make the
 * measurement a different build from the one it claims to measure, which is the
 * mistake ADR 0027 records having already made once.
 *
 * JavaScript rather than TypeScript because the measurement script is plain Node
 * and imports this file directly. `tsconfig.base.json` sets `allowJs`, so the

 * refuses outright), a JSX pass over `.js` files, `vite-plugin-commonjs`, the
 * React Native Web fixes, and `@vitejs/plugin-react`. The last of those is why
 * the site's config adds no React plugin of its own. `uniwind/vite` generates
 * the app's theme and its `.light`/`.dark` rules out of the stylesheet above.
 *
 * Both of them alias `react-native`, an alias list is searched first-match-first,
 * and the earlier plugin's entry is the one that survives the merge. Measured
 * both ways on 2026-09-11, on the built site, reading the drawn `Card` and
 * `Hairline` out of the DOM:
 *
 * | order | `Card`'s element | what it looks like |
 * |---|---|---|
 * | `rnw()`, then `uniwind()` | `css-g5y9jx rounded-md p-m bg-canvas border border-stroke` | correct, and follows the scheme |
 * | `uniwind()`, then `rnw()` | `css-g5y9jx` | **no ground, no border, no hairline at all** |
 *
 * With `react-native` pointing at `react-native-web`, `className` reaches the DOM
 * and the app's own stylesheet does the rest. Uniwind's components resolve a
 * `className` themselves instead, and in this bundle they resolve it to nothing.
 * The build is green either way, the measurement script reports 47 of 47 either
 * way, and the page renders either way — the components are simply unpainted,
 * which reads as a CSS problem and is a plugin-order one.
 *
 * `notADevApp()` is last, and that one is load-bearing too; see below.
