 * The four drawings, as four doors.
 *
 * They used to be one page nine screens tall, so looking at the third meant
 * scrolling past two others, each of which is a picture you are meant to study
 * rather than skim.
 *
 * The card carries the drawing itself, scaled to fit, and not a picture of it.
 * A thumbnail that is a separate asset is a thumbnail that goes stale, and these
 * are inline SVG with a `viewBox`, so a box and two rules are the whole cost of
 * having one that cannot.

        The same architecture the handbook explains in prose, drawn. Each one is hand-authored SVG
        whose every fill and stroke comes from a class, so it follows the light and dark schemes on
        its own and there is no second asset to keep in step.

        is the page for anyone who cannot use the picture.
