 * "Handbook / …" since the site was built, and there was nothing at the other end
 * of it. This is the other end.
 *
 * The drawings sit here rather than in a section of their own. Diagram 1 is
 * inside `ARCHITECTURE.md` itself now, which settles the question: they are not a
 * separate collection, they are this explanation in pictures.
