            `min-w-0`, on this box and on every ancestor up to `main`: a flex child
            refuses to shrink below its content without it, which is the fault that
            made this page scroll sideways before.

            `relative`, because the cells hold `sr-only` spans, which are absolutely
            positioned, and with no positioned ancestor their containing block is
            the page: they sit at their static position hundreds of pixels into a
            table this box clips, and although the table is clipped the spans are
            not. The page then scrolls sideways by their reach with nothing visible
            out there. Measured at a 1024px window: the box scrolled its 936px table
            inside 719px correctly and the window still scrolled 105px. This is the
            second time that has happened here, and it is why the kit's
            `ScrollArea` is written `relative overflow-hidden` too.
