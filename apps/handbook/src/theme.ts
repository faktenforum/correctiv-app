/**
 * Three states, not two, and "system" is the default.
 *
 * `TROUBLESHOOTING.md` numbers four appearance combinations and says the fourth,
 * the system setting against a dark device, is the app's default and the one that
 * has already shipped broken. A two-state toggle cannot express it, so this site
 * offers the same three the app does and puts no class on the root for "system",
 * which is what lets `prefers-color-scheme` decide.
 *
 * **Opening a page writes nothing, and that is the whole of issue #131.** The
 * effect below used to carry the storage write as well, so every document of this
 * site stamped its own reading of the setting back over the shared key on mount —
 * and because "system" is expressed by the key being ABSENT, a document that had
 * read "system" stamped it by DELETING the reader's choice. One document is
 * harmless; this site runs more than one on the origin. `workbench/AppFrame.tsx`
 * frames `<base>/app<route>`, and on a static host every path the app's export
 * does not contain is answered with the site's own `404.html`, which is a copy of
 * this application — measured on 2026-09-15 against a handbook-only `dist`, where
 * the framed document at `/app/` called both `setItem` and `removeItem` on this
 * key. A reading is therefore not a fact about what the reader wants, only about
 * what the store said when that document happened to start, and writing one back
 * is how a choice gets thrown away by a page that was only being looked at.
 *
 * So the store is written in one place, `rememberAppearance`, reached only from
 * the setter this returns — that is, only when somebody chooses. The effect stamps
 * the class and nothing else, and `test/theme.test.ts` fails if a write finds its
 * way back into it.
