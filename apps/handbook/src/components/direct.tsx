/**
 * The app's components, drawn by this site rather than framed.
 *
 * **The specimens are the app's own list, imported, not copied.** `CATALOGUE` in
 * `apps/mobile/src/gallery/catalogue.tsx` already says what every component is
 * shown with, in the props' own words, with the awkward cases deliberately in it.
 * Writing a second list here would be the two copies AGENTS.md exists to prevent,
 * and the app's own `__tests__/gallery-catalogue.test.ts` already fails when a
 * component is missing from it — a guarantee a list in this package could not
 * have.
 *
 * ADR 0027 shipped two entries typed out by hand, imported by file, to keep the
 * barrel's dependencies out of this bundle. That finding is unchanged and is
 * still about `apps/mobile`: the catalogue imports `@/components/ui`, so this
 * bundle now carries `@expo/vector-icons` and `expo-image`. It is paid
 * knowingly — every one of the 47 is drawn here, so every one of them is needed
 * anyway, and the alternative was a second catalogue. ADR 0028 records the
 * trade.
 *
 * What this file adds to the app's list is the one thing the app cannot know:
 * which components this site's React tree can actually mount. That is
 * `NOT_DRAWN` beside it, measured by looking, and it is a list of exceptions
 * rather than a list of members precisely because the catalogue is the roster.
