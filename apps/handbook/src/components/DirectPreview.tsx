// stylesheet, its five font files, the store, the safe area, the gesture root and
// the appearance handed to Uniwind. One definition, two hosts (ADR 0006).
//
// This file used to hold its own list — a `Provider` and a `SafeAreaProvider` and
// an `import '@/global.css'` — and the list was short by exactly the things
// nobody had thought of. Measured on 2026-09-11: no font file was loaded at all,
// so every drawn component read in the browser's standard face, which is a serif,
// and every bold string drew at regular weight. `test/environment.test.ts` fails
// if a second list starts here.

/**
 * A device with no notch, stated rather than measured.

 * answer, which inside a card is a component that never appears. Handing it
 * metrics skips the measurement, and zero insets is the truth here: this is a
 * page, not a phone, and `SafeAreaView` on a page has nothing to avoid. Without
 * the provider at all, five components throw — `LoginGate`, `RecoveryScreen`,
 * `Screen`, `ScreenHeader` and `SafeAreaView` all reach `useSafeAreaInsets`,
 * which refuses rather than defaulting. Measured on 2026-09-11: those five, and
 * nothing else in the catalogue.

/**
 * One or more of the app's specimens, drawn in this site's React tree.
 *
 * What this file decides is the STAGE — which ground the specimen stands on, how
 * wide the column is, whether the label is shown, and that one specimen's fault
 * is one specimen's fault. What the app decides is everything inside
 * `AppEnvironment`, and the split is the point: a stage is this site's business
 * and an environment is the app's.
 *
 * Two things the environment does not supply, and both are deliberate:
 *
 * - **The ports, which are nobody's here.** `packages/app-core`'s default
 *   platform is `createMemoryPlatform()`, so a thunk that reaches for storage or
 *   the bundle gets an empty answer instead of throwing. Nothing in a specimen
 *   dispatches one, and a component that started a fetch on mount degrades rather
 *   than fails.
 * - **The store's persisted state.** `coreStore` is the app's own instance and
 *   the components' bound actions are bound to it, but nothing hydrates it here,
 *   so every slice is at its default. That is what a specimen wants: the props in
 *   the catalogue decide what is drawn, not whatever the last visit left on disk.

/**

 * **Taken from the stored setting, not from the class on `<html>`, and that is
 * measured rather than stylistic.** Uniwind writes that class itself:
 * `setTheme('system')` resolves the device scheme once and stamps the answer back
 * on the root as an explicit `light` or `dark`. A reader of the class therefore
 * reads Uniwind's own output, mistakes it for the reader's choice, and pins the
 * site to whichever scheme the device had when the page loaded. Measured on the
 * built site on 2026-09-11, setting on System, device light, then the device
 * switched to dark while the page was open: `/components` stayed white while `/`
 * and `/architecture` went dark. The class says what is on screen; the setting
 * says what was asked for, and `'system'` is the one value where those differ.
 *
 * So `storedAppearance()` is the value and the class change is only the signal
 * that it moved — `theme.ts` writes both, in that order, and nothing else writes
 * the stored one. Taken from there rather than as a prop because `useAppearance`
 * is `useState` held in `App.tsx`, and a second call to it would be a second,
 * independent setting.
 *
 * Applying it is the app's business, not this file's: `AppEnvironment` hands it to
 * `useGivenAppearance`, which is the one line in the repository that calls
 * `Uniwind.setTheme`. That hook also re-resolves `'system'` when the device scheme
 * moves, which is the fourth combination in TROUBLESHOOTING.md and the one that
 * has shipped broken before.
