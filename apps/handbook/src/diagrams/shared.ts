/*
 * The drawings' vocabulary, which used to be a stylesheet.
 *
 * Tailwind utilities work on SVG elements, so `fill-canvas` and `stroke-stroke`
 * say on a `rect` what they say on a `div`, and both read the same token the app
 * reads. What a plain utility cannot say is that eighteen chips are one thing, so
 * each visual role keeps its name here. A role named once is a role that cannot
 * drift across three diagrams, which is the whole reason the deleted sheet had
 * these names.
 *
 * Every one of them is a token, never a literal. That is what makes the drawings
 * follow the light and dark schemes with no second asset to keep in step, and
 * `test/styles.test.ts` fails the build on a colour value written here.
