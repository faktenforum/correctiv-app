/**
 * The open view's sections, read off the page rather than declared twice.
 *
 * A document arrives with its headings extracted at build time. The four pages
 * built as components have no such list, and they are the longest things on the
 * site: the reference is fifty-three modules and about thirty screens, the
 * diagrams and the board about eight each. A second hand-kept list of their
 * sections would be a list that drifts, so the shell reads the headings the page
 * actually rendered.
 *
 * Only headings with an id, because the list navigates by fragment and an entry
 * that scrolls nowhere is worse than no entry. The observer is for the reference
 * page's filter, which adds and removes modules as it is typed in.
