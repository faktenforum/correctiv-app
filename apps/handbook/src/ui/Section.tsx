/**
 * One collapsible section of the right panel, and the two slots it offers.
 *
 * This was `Panel`, private to `workbench/ui/Panels.tsx`, where a comment said
 * "which panels are open is local to this component". It is lifted here
 * unchanged in what it draws and changed in two things: whether it is open comes
 * from the address, so it is in the URL and can be handed over as a link, and
 * what is inside it comes from the open page through a portal rather than from a
 * child this file is given.
 *
 * `forceMount` on the body is load-bearing. Radix unmounts a closed panel's
 * content, which would take the slot's target with it — and with the target gone
 * the page's `Slot` renders nothing, so the console's level filter and the
 * component route's device choice would both reset every time somebody collapsed
 * the section they live in. Mounted and `hidden` keeps them, and `hidden` is
 * `display: none`, so a shut section is out of the accessibility tree either way.
 *
 * The hover is `surface` on the panel's own `canvas`, which is the inverse of
 * the dock this came from: `SidePanel` paints `canvas`, so a row that hovered to
 * `canvas` hovered to no change at all.
