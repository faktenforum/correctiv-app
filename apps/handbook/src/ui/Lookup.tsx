 * The filter over a lookup surface, with what it currently leaves standing.
 *
 * `/reference` lists the core's symbols and `/components` the app's components.
 * They answer different questions and stay two pages for that reason, but they
 * are built from the same three parts, which are this file: a filter, a row that
 * opens onto the detail, and a link into the repository. Two copies of the row
 * would be two places for the search palette's contract with it to be got wrong.
 *
 * Sticky, because a lookup surface whose filter has scrolled away is a list.
 * `top-0`, not an offset: the scroller is the shell's main area, which begins
 * below the header, so an offset here would leave a gap the page scrolls through.

 * a row by setting `open` on the element it finds by id. The React state here
 * only mirrors that back for `aria-expanded`; the element itself stays the owner
 * of whether it is open, so an open from the palette is not undone on the next
 * render.
 *
 * `text-s` on the row is for a child that cannot state its own size: the kit's
 * badge carries one in the same tailwind-merge group as its colour, so `cn` keeps
 * the last of the two and a badge can have the colour or the size and not both.
 * Every other child states its own, so setting it here costs nothing.
