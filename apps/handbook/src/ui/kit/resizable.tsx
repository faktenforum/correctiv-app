 * Split panes, which is the one piece of furniture a hand-written stylesheet

 *
 * The workbench needs the frame and the dock to share the width on terms the
 * reader sets, and keyboard resizing comes with the primitive.
 *
 * shadcn's wrapper is written against version 2 of this package, and version 4
 * moved a good deal: the exports are `Group` and `Separator` rather than
 * `PanelGroup` and `PanelResizeHandle`, and a group takes its orientation from
 * its own flex direction rather than from a `direction` prop. The names are
 * mapped here so no caller carries the difference.
 *
 * One rule of version 4 is worth knowing before writing a size: a NUMBER is
 * pixels and a STRING is a percentage. `defaultSize={38}` is thirty-eight
 * pixels, not thirty-eight percent, and it renders as a sliver rather than as an
 * error. Write `"38%"`.

 * it, or every frame sets a new target and the panel trails the pointer by the
 * length of the transition. The library exposes the drag state on the separator
 * it belongs to and not to the panels, so this reads it from the document
 * instead: one listener for the whole page, which is what the answer is anyway.

 * has not registered that panel yet, and it has not when the effect runs in the
 * same commit that mounted it. Crossing the narrow/wide line does exactly that:
 * resize a window past 64rem and both panels mount and are told what to do in one
 * breath. The throw took the whole view down, boundary or no boundary.
 *
 * So it tries, and if the group is not ready it tries again on the next frame,
 * by which time it is.
