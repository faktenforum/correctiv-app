/**
 * Storage fixtures: what the app finds when it boots.
 *
 * The shell and the app share an origin, so `window.localStorage` here **is** the
 * app's storage. Writing it before the frame is pointed at a route is therefore
 * the whole mechanism — no handshake, no cooperation from the app, and it works
 * against the static export too, where the dev handle does not exist.
 *
 * This is the half of state control a dispatch cannot do: `onboardingDone` is
 * read by the root layout before the first render, and the feed cascade consults
 * the cache on its way up. Everything that can wait until after boot goes through
 * the handle instead (`frame/handle.ts`), because that speaks the core's
 * vocabulary rather than copying its storage layout.
 *
 * Two things about the layout, both load-bearing and both cheap to get wrong:
 * `persist()` writes back only the keys a slice declares, so anything invented
 * here is dropped on the app's first write; and a payload that is not valid JSON
 * is not ignored but **deleted**, and the slice starts empty.

/**
 * Opens the door, and touches nothing else.
 *
 * `applyFixture` above is for someone who asked for a state: it wipes first, so a
 * fixture describes a whole state rather than a patch. That is wrong for a frame
 * that appears because a reader opened a row on `/components` — they asked to see
 * a button drawn, not to have the demo app's saved articles cleared.
 *
 * So: the session key, and only when the door is actually shut. Nothing else is
 * read or written, and a reader who is already signed in keeps the account they
 * signed in with.
 *
 * A frame does need this. The app's root layout renders the gate INSTEAD of the
 * router until the session carries an entitlement, so a frame pointed at
 * `/gallery` without one draws the sign-in form, which is what the link out of
 * `/components` did for every reader of the published site. Storage is the only
 * key that works there, because the static export carries no dev handle to
 * dispatch through, which is the same argument the file header makes.
 *
 * `settings` is deliberately left alone: the onboarding redirect fires only from
 * `/`, and nothing this is used for starts there. What it writes does outlive the
 * page, like every fixture — the next visit to `/workbench` that names no fixture
 * finds this session rather than the door.
 *
 * **Two `try` blocks and not one.** A store that cannot be read is the ordinary
 * case, and the answer to it is to write; a store that cannot be *written* is a
 * browser with site data switched off, and there is no answer to it at all. One
 * block put the write in the catch of the read, so a blocked store threw out of
 * the effect that calls this and React unmounted the page: measured against a
 * `localStorage` whose accessors throw `SecurityError`, `/components` rendered its
 * error boundary and none of the 46 rows. A frame that draws the door is worse
 * than one that draws a component and far better than no reference page.
