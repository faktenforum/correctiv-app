/**
 * Send the frame to a route through the app's own router, and put the address back.

 * The address alone cannot do it in development, and the reason is upstream:

 * `NODE_ENV !== 'development'`, so a dev bundle framed at `/app/` matches
 * `/app/gespeichert` against its own routes, finds nothing, and renders
 * `+not-found`. Measured 2026-09-10 with both servers running: every framed route
 * did that, `/app/` included, which is worse than
 * [ADR 0025](../../../../../adr/0025-the-published-app-is-a-production-bundle.md)
 * had recorded.
 *
 * So the route travels the way everything else in this directory travels, by
 * same-origin property access ([ADR 0014](../../../../../adr/0014-the-preview-shell-as-a-package.md)),
 * and the address is restored immediately afterwards. Restoring it is not cosmetic:
 * the router writes `/gespeichert`, a path on the HANDBOOK's origin, and a reload of
 * the frame would then leave the app entirely and render the handbook's own 404
 * inside it. Measured, both the fault and the fix.
 *
 * Returns whether it navigated. `false` means there is no handle, which is the
 * normal state of the published export — and the state in which the address works
 * by itself, because a production bundle does apply the base path. The two halves
 * cover the two builds exactly, which is why neither needs a flag.
