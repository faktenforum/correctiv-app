/**
 * The frame, at the size of a device, and the handles that change that size.
 *
 * Why an iframe and not a web-only wrapper inside the app: inside the frame the
 * app's own `window` **is** the device. `useWindowDimensions`, media queries
 * (including the reader's 48rem breakpoint) and scroll behaviour all report the
 * simulated size. A wrapper in `_layout.tsx` would draw a phone frame while the
 * app still measured the desktop window, which is a preview that lies. It also
 * keeps every line of this out of the app bundle and the native builds.
 *
 * Nothing is injected into the frame for sizing, deliberately: measured at
 * 393px, the app reports `innerWidth` 393 and `clientWidth` 393, so no desktop
 * scrollbar is eating layout width and there is nothing to compensate for.
 *
 * The graph-paper ground is `stage-grid`, the one piece of decoration in
 * `styles/app.css`. It is there so the frame reads as a thing standing on a
 * surface rather than a white box on a white page, which is what it looked like
 * without it.
