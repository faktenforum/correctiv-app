 * Everything here goes through the same `store.set()` the toolbar uses, which is
 * the point: an automated walk and a human walk cannot end up looking at
 * different things.
 *
 * A caller outside this page works in three verbs — say what you want, wait
 * until it is on screen, ask what is actually there — and those are `set`,
 * `ready` and `get`. The rest is the vocabulary those three take (`devices`,
 * `routes`, `fixtures`) and what the frame has to say for itself (`logs`,
 * `audit`).
 *
 * `set()` resolving only after the frame has settled is the part worth keeping.
 * It turns "navigate, then sleep 2000, then screenshot" into one await, and it
 * is the difference between a screenshot of the app and a screenshot of its
 * first paint.
