 *
 * **It no longer writes the address.** It used to, behind an `owning` flag, which
 * was this file knowing that the shell had other views and that the hash belonged
 * to them while one was open. The shell owns the hash on every route now
 * (`shell/address.ts`), and `pages/Workbench.tsx` is the one place the two are
 * joined: state out through `toAddress`, address in through `fromAddress`. The
 * flag is gone with the thing it was guarding against.
