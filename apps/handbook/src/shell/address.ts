/**
 * The hash, on every route, as one grammar.
 *
 * `#<head>?<params>`. The head is an app route on `/workbench` (`/artikel`), a
 * heading id on a document (`the-four-ports`), and empty elsewhere. The
 * parameters are the shell's own — `tools`, `open`, `full` — plus everything the
 * open view keeps in `rest`, which on the workbench is the five original frame
 * parameters and on the component route is the device and the rendering.
 *
 * **The two halves cannot collide**, which is what lets one grammar serve both: an
 * app route starts with `/` and a heading id never does, because `plugin/markdown.ts`'s
 * `slug()` strips everything but letters, digits, spaces and hyphens.
 *
 * **A parameter is written only when it differs from the view's declared
 * default.** That is what keeps a document clean: a reader who toggled nothing
 * keeps a plain `#the-four-ports`, and the link most people paste is what it was
 * before this file existed. It is also what makes a stale parameter harmless —
 * the hash goes with the route, and what it says is re-read against the new
 * view's defaults rather than carried over.
 *
 * The one thing it costs: `#the-four-ports?tools=1` is not an anchor the browser
 * scrolls to, because the fragment is no longer an element id. The site already
 * scrolls itself for in-site links (`router.tsx`), and `App.tsx` does the other
 * half on load.
