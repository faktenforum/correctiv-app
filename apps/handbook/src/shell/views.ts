/**
 * What each view of this site offers the shell, declared before it renders.
 *
 * The shell used to ask the page. `App.tsx` special-cased the workbench seven
 * times and decided the right sidebar from two booleans, which meant the panel's
 * existence was known only after the page had rendered something — so the toggle
 * and the default-open state were right one commit late, and the workbench was a
 * second site rather than a view. Here the **route declares and the page fills**:
 * the table below says which sections a view has, the page supplies their content
 * through `shell/slots.tsx`, and `test/shell.test.ts` fails when the two disagree.
 *
 * Pure data on purpose, no React and no icon. `test/shell.test.ts` imports this
 * file to check every route in the site against it, and a test that had to pull
 * the page tree in to ask about a string is a test that stops being run. The
 * icons live beside the chrome that draws them, in `ui/Section.tsx`, keyed by the
 * same type, so a section with a title and no icon is a type error.
