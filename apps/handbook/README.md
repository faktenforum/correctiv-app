# @correctiv/handbook

The published site: this repository's own documentation, an inventory of what the
app reads, the architecture drawn, a reference generated from the core, and the app
itself in a device frame.

It is what answers at the root of
[faktenforum.github.io/correctiv-app](https://faktenforum.github.io/correctiv-app/).
`pages.yml` publishes the app's web export beneath it, at `/app/`.

```
/                    landing
/architecture        ARCHITECTURE.md
/sources             the status board
/sources/measured    SOURCES.md, the record the board is built from
/decisions           the index · /decisions/0022 one record
/diagrams            the core and its host, the records, the core's layers
/reference           every exported symbol in packages/app-core
/workbench           the app in a device frame, with the inspector
/traps /conventions /readme /release
```

## The rule this package is built around

**It holds no copy of any document.** `plugin/` reads `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `adr/*.md`,
`SOURCES.md` and the rest where they live, parses them at build time, and rewrites
every link: a relative `*.md` becomes a route here, and anything else becomes a link
into the repository **at the commit the page was built from**, so a page describing a
line keeps pointing at that line.

A second copy of `ARCHITECTURE.md` would be the one on the website, and it would be
the one nobody edits.

## Running it

```bash
npm run handbook   # this site at localhost:5173
npm run app        # the app it frames, at localhost:8081
```

Both, if you want the workbench. Without the second command the frame is empty and the
dock says the store handle is absent.

The dev server proxies three paths to the app's server, so the browser sees one
origin: `/app` for the app itself, and `/apps` and `/assets` because the app's own
HTML asks for its bundle and its fonts absolutely, from the origin root, whatever base
path it is given. Proxying only `/app` left the bundle request answered by this server
instead, and the frame stayed white while the console said the script came back as
JSON. The `/app` rule is a regular expression rather than the plain prefix, because
Vite matches proxy keys as prefixes and `/app` is a prefix of `/apps`.

Against a static export instead, which is what Pages serves:

```bash
npm run build:web                       # the app
npm run build:handbook                  # this site
rm -rf site && cp -r apps/handbook/dist site && cp -r apps/mobile/dist site/app
node screens/tools/serve-clean.mjs site 8099
```

## The published app is a development build

`build:web` exports with `--dev`, so the deployed app keeps `__DEV__` true and leaves
its handle on its own global. That is what makes the workbench work on the published
site rather than only against a local dev server: with a production export the
appearance panel and the inspector are inert, and the dock says so on every panel.

It costs about a third more JavaScript and the app carries React's development
warnings. The console panel shows those rather than hiding them, which on a debugging
surface is the right way round.

## Same-origin, and why it is load-bearing

Everything the workbench does to the app is a same-origin property access:
`contentWindow`, `matchMedia`, `documentElement.classList`, `localStorage`, and the
handle the app leaves on its own global. Across origins the browser refuses those
reads silently, so the failure is a tool that looks fine and answers nothing.

On Pages the deploy uploads both halves as one artifact, so `/` and `/app/` are the
same origin. In development the proxy above does the same job. Do not give this package a
second origin. [ADR 0014](../../adr/0014-the-preview-shell-as-a-package.md) records the
constraint, [ADR 0024](../../adr/0024-the-handbook-owns-the-root.md) records why the
site meets it this way.

## What is generated

| Command | Produces |
| --- | --- |
| `npm run api -w @correctiv/handbook` | `content/api.generated.json`, extracted with `typedoc --json` |

TypeDoc runs as a data extractor and never as a site generator. No HTML, no theme.
This site's own components render the model. A generated documentation site would
have arrived with its own navigation and its own design, and it would have become the
front door by accident.

Not committed. It is derived, it is large, and `npm run build` regenerates it first.

## The tests, and what they are for

Four of them exist because of a failure that had already happened and that no other
check could see.

| File | Catches |
| --- | --- |
| `test/docs.test.ts` | a document link pointing at a path that has moved, and struck-through claims counted twice or losing the clause that voids them |
| `test/sources.test.ts` | a file added to `packages/app-core/src/data/` with no entry in the manifest, so sample data reaches a screen and not the inventory |
| `test/routes.test.ts` | a page shadowing a document, which removes it from the site with no error |
| `test/styles.test.ts` | a colour value written here instead of taken from `packages/design-tokens`, which forks the palette invisibly, and the entry stylesheet importing the theme without the variants that choose between light and dark |

## Colour

Taken from `packages/design-tokens`, not written here. `src/styles/app.css` imports
`theme.standalone.css`, which is the file the app consumes too, so `bg-canvas` means
one thing in both and a colour has nowhere to fork to. A hand-written copy had three
values wrong within the hour, one of them the brand red, which the dark scheme
lightens to `#ff6173` for contrast on a dark ground.

There is one stylesheet, and its own header says why: `src/styles/app.css`. The site
used to carry five, each drawn as a standalone page and styling `html`, `h1` and
`code` directly, which is correct in a standalone file and reaches every page here.
