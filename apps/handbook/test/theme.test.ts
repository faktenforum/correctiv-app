/**
 * Issue #131: the setting was gone after a reload, and nothing had chosen "System".
 *
 * It was this site deleting it. The mount effect used to carry the storage write
 * as well as the class, so every document of the handbook wrote its own reading of
 * the setting back to the shared key as it came up — and since "system" is the key
 * being ABSENT, a document that had read "system" wrote it by calling `removeItem`
 * on somebody's choice. That is harmless while the site has one document and it is
 * not a site with one document: `workbench/AppFrame.tsx` frames `<base>/app<route>`
 * on the same origin, and a static host answers every path the app's export does
 * not contain with the site's own `404.html`, which is a second copy of this
 * application. Measured in Chrome on 2026-09-15 against a handbook-only `dist`: the
 * framed document at `/app/` ran this hook and both wrote and removed this key.
 *
 * So the guarantee to keep is that **reading is not writing**. A document may read
 * the setting as it starts; only a click may write it. Everything below is that one
 * sentence, from both ends: the mount path may not reach the store, and the store
 * has exactly one writer.
