/**
 * The two readings of a frame's address, and both of them shipped wrong once.
 *
 * A frame on `/components` is pointed at an address and then handed its route
 * through the app's own router, because in a development build the address alone
 * lands on the app's 404. Which of those has happened cannot be asked of the
 * address in the obvious way, and the obvious way is what failed:
 *
 * - "the document is complete" is true of `about:blank`, which is the document a
 *   frame starts with, so it says nothing on its own. The address has to agree,
 *   and it is read from `document.URL` — the document's own address rather than
 *   the browsing context's.
 * - "the app took the route" is not a path being right but the base path being
 *   *gone*, because a development bundle does not put it back on a navigation.
 *   And `about:blank`'s path is the bare string "blank", which carries no base
 *   either: without the protocol test, a frame that has been nowhere reads as a
 *   frame the app has taken over.
 *
 * Fake windows rather than a browser, because both functions are one line about a
 * pair of strings, and the strings are what was wrong.
