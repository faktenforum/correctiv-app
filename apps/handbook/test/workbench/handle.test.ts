 * The two halves of driving the framed app by property access.

 * `keepFramePath` rewriting the address of a frame the app is not running in put the
 * shell in a deadlock it could not leave, because `frameRoute` then reported a route
 * the app had never been sent to and the effect that navigates found nothing to do.
 * A fake window is enough for both, since neither reads anything only a browser can
 * answer.
