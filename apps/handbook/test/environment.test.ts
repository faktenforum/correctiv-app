 * One environment, two hosts, and the checks that keep it from becoming two.

 * to put around them whatever the app puts around them. It did that with a list
 * of its own for one change, and the list was short by exactly the things nobody
 * had thought of: no font file was loaded, so all 45 components drew in the
 * browser's standard face — a serif — and every bold string drew at regular
 * weight, because this app names one loaded family per cut. A drifting copy is
 * the failure mode, so what is asserted here is that there is no copy.
 *
 * Read as text rather than rendered, which is the same choice `direct.test.ts`
 * and `shell.test.ts` make and for the same reason: rendering a specimen to ask
 * which providers are above it would need `react-native-web`, a DOM and the
 * app's whole toolchain to answer a question about imports.
