  /**
   * The one rule that replaced four weaker ones.
   *
   * The handbook used to carry five hand-written stylesheets, and the guards here
   * were about keeping them from colliding: names shared between sheets, bare
   * element selectors, layout elements styled by the prose sheet. Tailwind and
   * one entry stylesheet make all of that impossible to express, so what is left
   * to protect is the thing those guards were really for.
   *
   * `packages/design-tokens` decides colour. The app consumes it through Uniwind
   * and this package consumes the same file through Tailwind, which is why
   * `bg-canvas` means one thing in both. A literal colour written here is a fork,
   * and a fork is invisible until somebody changes the palette and one of the two
   * does not move.
   *
   * Two exceptions, both deliberate. A scrim over the page is not a role in the
   * palette, and `black/40` is the honest way to say a translucent black. And
   * `workbench/frame/` writes CSS into the app's document rather than this one,
   * where these class names do not exist, and reads computed colours back out of
   * it to compare against the palette. That code has to work in literals; it is
   * the only code here that does.
